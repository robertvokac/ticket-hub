# Verification record

## 2026-09-25 — GitHub Pages publishing workflow

- Compared `../lexicon/.github/workflows/pages.yml` with Ticket Hub's branch and directory layout.
  The Ticket Hub repository's GitHub metadata reports `develop` as the default branch.
- The new workflow validates the static presentation site, uploads `web/` as the Pages artifact, and
  deploys through `actions/deploy-pages@v4` with the required Pages and OIDC permissions.
- The owner unarchived the repository after the workflow was prepared. Commit `cd05c06` was pushed to
  `develop`; [the Pages run](https://github.com/robertvokac/ticket-hub/actions/runs/36116285761)
  passed checkout and the static-site check, but `actions/configure-pages@v5` failed with “Get Pages
  site failed ... Not Found”. Pages must first be enabled with GitHub Actions as the source. The connected
  GitHub account has no administrator access, so it cannot change Pages source/custom-domain settings.
  `getent ahosts tickethub.robertvokac.com` resolved to GitHub Pages addresses, including
  `robertvokac.github.io`. The HTTPS endpoint did not yet present a certificate for the custom domain;
  live site verification remains pending.
- The push also ran `Verify`: its SQLite and all-adapters C++ jobs passed. Its browser/accessibility job
  failed on existing ticket-drawer axe violations; the same targets appear in the preceding commit's
  browser job. This is separate from the Pages deployment failure.
- No database migration or product runtime change was made in this batch.

## 2026-09-25 — Application UI move and static presentation site

- Before editing: the existing SQLite/server build completed and all 11 baseline CTest suites passed.
- After editing: the SQLite/server build completed; `ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure` passed
  12/12 suites, including the new static-presentation link/landmark check. The SQLite-only core/CLI
  preset also built and passed 12/12 suites.
- A live SQLite server, started from the repository root with no `TICKETHUB_WEB_ROOT` override, served
  the original application shell at `/` and returned HTTP 200 for `/styles.css`, `/app.js`,
  `/story-points.js`, and `/api/health`. This verifies that the new default points to
  `ticket-hub-web/`, not the independent `web/` presentation site.
- A local static HTTP server returned 200 for all five presentation pages, its CSS/JavaScript, and
  representative screenshot assets. `cmake --install` placed the application UI under
  `share/ticket-hub/ticket-hub-web` and did not install the presentation site in the Crow asset path.
- After the language correction, all five pages and their local URLs are English. The site integrity
  test checks image dimension attributes against the actual PNG headers (1440 × 900 for the copied
  application screenshots). The CSS now uses natural image height with no forced aspect ratio, cropping,
  or hover zoom.
- The dual-adapter preset configured, but PostgreSQL adapter compilation stopped because this
  environment has no `libpq-fe.h` development header; its old cached include path points to a removed
  temporary directory. A fresh PostgreSQL-only configure also failed to find the PostgreSQL development
  library/header pair, so PostgreSQL-only compilation was not possible here. Docker Compose
  validation was also unavailable because the `docker` executable is not installed.
- The Playwright suite was not run because its `node_modules` dependencies are absent in this checkout;
  the available computer-use session also exposed no browser. No browser layout or interaction audit was
  run. The presentation-site check covers local references,
  anchors, document landmarks, language, and image alt text; it does not validate visual rendering.

## 2026-08-26 — Security audit remediation

### What changed

Fixes for all 16 findings of an external security audit of the network-facing surface (2 critical, 3 high,
5 medium, 6 low). See the `CHANGELOG.md` entry of the same date for the per-finding list and
`docs/THREAT_MODEL.md` for the analysis.

### Verification

**Automated.** `ctest --output-on-failure` -- 11/11 suites pass in all three built configurations (default
server build, `sqlite` preset, `all-adapters` preset), including three new ones
(`ticket-hub-config-tests`, `ticket-hub-attachment-content-type-tests`,
`ticket-hub-network-address-tests`) and four extended ones (rate limiter, crypto, identity,
authorization). The frontend was parsed with SpiderMonkey via `gjs` (`Reflect.parse`, module target):
`web/app.js`, `web/story-points.js` and `web/ticket-drawer-controls.js` all parse cleanly.

**Live, against a running server** (SQLite, throwaway database, `127.0.0.1:18080`):

- **C1** -- a default start (`TICKETHUB_DB_DRIVER=sqlite`, nothing else set) creates no accounts:
  `demo@ticket-hub.local` / `demo12345` returns `401`. With `TICKETHUB_SEED_DEMO=true` and
  `TICKETHUB_BIND_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0` the process refuses to start and prints the reason; adding
  `TICKETHUB_ALLOW_UNSAFE_DEMO_SEED=true` lets it start and serve `200` on `/api/health`.
- **C2** -- the same 51-byte HTML payload uploaded as `TEXT/HTML`, `Text/Html;charset=utf-8`,
  `image/SVG+XML`, `text/html` and `application/xhtml+xml` now all return
  `Content-Disposition: attachment`; `text/plain` and `application/pdf` still return `inline`. Navigating
  headless Chromium directly to the `TEXT/HTML` attachment produces no script execution and an empty DOM
  (before the fix the same navigation logged `executed at http://127.0.0.1:18080`).
- **Attachment previews** -- a same-origin `<iframe>` pointing at an inline `text/plain` attachment now
  loads and its `contentDocument` contains the attachment body. A control iframe pointing at
  `/api/health`, which still carries the unchanged `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, is refused -- confirming that
  `DENY` had been blocking the D99 preview iframes all along.
- **H2** -- 30 failed logins against one address trip at attempt 21 (`429`), while the demo administrator
  signs in normally (`200`) from the same IP; 25 consecutive *successful* logins all return `200`,
  confirming the success path consumes no budget.
- **H3/M1** -- exercised as integration tests rather than live, since the lock window is 15 real minutes:
  `expireLoginLock` backdates `locked_until` directly in the SQLite file (a test helper, deliberately not
  a method on `IDatabase`), after which a single wrong password no longer re-locks the account and the
  correct password works.
- **M2, L2, M1 in a real browser** -- headless Chromium against the app origin: the pre-session
  `__Host-th_csrf` cookie is present and readable on first load (32 chars); `__Host-th_session` is set on
  login and is *not* visible to JavaScript; `GET /api/v1/auth/me` returns `200`; a CSRF-protected write
  returns `200` with the header and `403` without it; login with a wrong `X-CSRF-Token` returns `403` and
  with the correct one `200`, rotating the cookie; a self-service password change returns `200` and leaves
  the calling session signed in. This is the check that mattered for `__Host-` -- curl ignores cookie
  prefix rules, so only a browser proves the rename did not break sign-in.
- **Negative probes, unchanged from the audit** -- SQL injection through filter parameters, path traversal
  on the static and attachment routes, and error-message disclosure all still return clean results.

### Known limitations

- The PostgreSQL adapter **compiles** but was **not run**: this environment has no PostgreSQL server. Both
  adapters received logically equivalent changes (`recordFailedLogin`'s expired-lock clear,
  `totalAttachmentBytes`, and the `PGPASSWORD` split, the last of which exists only in the PostgreSQL
  adapter). All three supported configurations were built and tested: the default server build, the
  `sqlite` preset (11/11), and the `all-adapters` preset (11/11), the last confirming
  `PostgresDatabase.cpp.o` builds warning-free against libpq 17.11 headers. Only the SQLite adapter's
  behaviour was executed.
- The Playwright browser suite was **not** run -- `node`/`node_modules` are unavailable here. Browser
  verification was done by driving headless Chromium directly, as described above.
- H1 has no in-process fix and therefore no test: the reverse-proxy body limit is the only mitigation, and
  it is now documented as a hard prerequisite in `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`.
- M5 resolves the webhook target at creation time only, so it does not defend against DNS rebinding. The
  unit tests cover URL parsing and IP-range classification offline; no test performs a real DNS lookup.

## 2026-08-08 — Fixed Story Points picker and adaptable ticket detail drawer, user-requested

### What changed

- Replaced free-number Story Points controls in ticket create/edit with the fixed Jira-style scale `0`,
  `0.25`, `0.5`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `5`, `8`, `13`, `20`, `40`, `100`, plus "Not estimated" and a concise
  "Relative effort, not hours" explanation. An existing nonstandard numeric value is shown as an explicit
  selected legacy option during edit, so adopting the picker cannot silently erase data created by an older
  client or API integration.
- The ticket drawer now has a pointer-draggable, keyboard-operable left-edge resize handle; Arrow keys
  change its width, Shift+Arrow uses a larger step, and Home/End jump to the allowed limits. The normal
  width persists in `localStorage` under `ticket-hub.ticket-drawer-width`. A header button toggles a full
  browser-width view; Escape exits that view before applying its usual close-drawer behavior. On narrow
  screens the drawer remains full width and the resize handle is hidden.

### Verification

- Parsed the entire `web/app.js` with GJS's JavaScript parser. A focused harness verified that the standard
  `0.5` picker value is selected, legacy `2.5` is preserved, and drawer-width limits clamp to 94% of the
  viewport.
- `git diff --check` is clean. No C++/schema/API code changed. A clean CMake build could not run in this
  checkout: its inherited `build/` cache points to a removed source path, while a new configure fails before
  generation because the environment lacks Argon2 development headers/libraries.

## 2026-08-05 — Kanban board: drag-and-drop reordering within a column, user-requested

User asked why they couldn't reorder tickets on the board ("proc nemohu zmenit poradi ticketu na
boardu?"). Investigation found the board's existing drag-and-drop (added earlier as post-V1 batch 3)
explicitly no-ops a drop back into the ticket's own column -- only cross-column drags (status changes)
were ever handled; `handleBoardDrop` returned immediately when `ticket.status.key === targetStatusKey`.
Manual reordering (D31) already existed and already worked, just only via ↑/↓ buttons on the Tickets and
Backlog screens, never on the board itself. User confirmed they wanted this added.

### What changed

- `renderBoard()`'s per-column ticket list is now sorted by `rankOrder` (`tickets.filter(...).sort((a, b)
  => a.rankOrder - b.rankOrder)`), matching the sort the Tickets/Backlog screens already apply -- without
  this, a column had no stable order for a drop position to be computed against, and any reorder would
  appear to silently revert on the next render (`fetchBoardTickets` requests the API's default
  `updated_at DESC` order, not rank order).
- New `boardDropInsertionBeforeKey(list, clientY, draggedTicketKey)`: walks the target column's cards
  (excluding the one being dragged) and returns the key of the first card whose vertical midpoint is below
  the drop's `clientY` -- the same "insert before this key" meaning `reorderTicket`'s `beforeTicketKey`
  already has, so it can call the exact endpoint the ↑/↓ buttons use. Returns `null` (append to the end)
  once the cursor is past every card.
- `handleBoardDrop` now branches on whether the drop's target column matches the ticket's current status:
  a different column still runs the existing status-change path unchanged (including the Done-category
  resolution prompt, D68-D70); the *same* column now computes a `beforeTicketKey` and calls a new
  `applyBoardReorder(ticketKey, beforeTicketKey)`, which posts to `/api/v1/tickets/{key}/reorder` and
  re-renders the board -- no new backend route, this reuses D31's existing one. A drop computed to land at
  the card's current position (compared against the column's actual current order, not just "did the
  column change") is skipped rather than sent as a no-op API call.
- No new keyboard path was added -- reordering was already keyboard-operable via the Tickets/Backlog ↑/↓
  buttons (native HTML5 drag-and-drop itself still has no keyboard equivalent), the same reasoning already
  documented for the pre-existing cross-column drag.

### How it was verified

No C++ changed -- frontend-only (`web/app.js`). Full rebuild and `ctest --output-on-failure` clean (8/8)
as a sanity check that nothing else regressed.

Live end-to-end over real HTTP against the actual compiled server and the local dev SQLite database (the
Chrome browser extension needed to simulate an actual mouse drag was still not connected in this
environment, so the exact request the new drop handler computes and sends was issued directly instead):
seeded tickets TH-5 (`rankOrder` 5) and TH-6 (`rankOrder` 6) both sit in the `backlog` column. Sent `POST
/api/v1/tickets/TH-6/reorder {"beforeTicketKey": "TH-5"}` -- exactly what dropping TH-6 just above TH-5
would compute -- and confirmed via a fresh `GET .../tickets?project=TH&status=backlog&sort=rank` that the
order became `[TH-6, TH-5]`, i.e. the swap actually persisted and would survive a re-render (not just a
one-time response). Reordered back to the original `[TH-5, TH-6]` afterward. Confirmed the served `/app.js`
contains `boardDropInsertionBeforeKey`/`applyBoardReorder`. Confirmed the dev database matched its original
seeded rank order before stopping the server.

## 2026-08-05 — Web admin user management (D2/D53/D57), user-requested

User asked, after the picker-hardcoding fix above, where they could manage user accounts as an admin. The
answer at the time was "nowhere -- `ticket-hub-cli create-user` is the entire story, and it can't even list/
deactivate/reset anyone." User confirmed the design proposed in chat (list, create, deactivate/reactivate,
promote/demote admin, admin-performed password reset, grounded in the existing decision register rather
than a bespoke design) and asked for it to be built.

### Design grounding

Checked `docs/REDUCED_SCOPE_DECISIONS.md` before writing any code, since `CLAUDE.md` requires an explicit
product conversation before new scope and forbids building anything on
`docs/REMOVED_AND_DEFERRED_FEATURES.md` without one. Found this was **not** new scope at all -- it is a
decided-but-never-implemented gap, the same class of finding as post-V1 batch 8's five-decision audit:

- **Decision 2 (Registration modes):** admin-created accounts only, no self-registration/invitation --
  preserved; this feature adds no new way for an account to come into existence except an existing admin
  creating one, whether via CLI or the new web page.
- **Decision 53 (Password security):** "replace email-based reset with admin-performed reset (sets a
  temporary password)" -- exactly what `adminResetPassword` implements. Keeps Argon2id, rate limiting,
  lockout, and adds the "session invalidation after password change" the original decision also called for.
- **Decision 56 (User identity fields):** immutable UUID, unique email, optional unique handle -- untouched;
  no editing of identity fields was added.
- **Decision 57 (User departure/duplicates):** "Deactivation only; no anonymization, no account merge" --
  exactly what `adminSetUserActive` implements; no delete/anonymize/merge action exists or was considered.
- `docs/REMOVED_AND_DEFERRED_FEATURES.md` has no entry blocking any of this -- only D52 (outbound email) is
  mentioned, and only to note it's superseded by Decision 53's admin-performed reset.
- The `users.active`/`is_admin` columns already existed in the schema (provisioned since Phase 1) and were
  already enforced at the auth layer (`AuthService::login`/`validateSession`/`validatePersonalAccessToken`
  already reject a deactivated user) -- they were simply never exposed for editing after account creation.
  No migration was needed.
- Two implementation choices have no decision text covering them, so conservative defaults were chosen and
  are recorded here rather than in a separate ADR (this project has never used standalone ADR files --
  every prior undecided-default choice, e.g. D54's "sign out everywhere keeps the caller's own session,"
  was documented directly in this file, so the same convention is followed here): (1) an administrator can
  never deactivate their own account or remove their own admin privileges through this UI/API -- both risk
  a confusing self-lockout, rejected with `400` rather than merely discouraged; (2) the temporary password
  from an admin-performed reset is auto-generated and shown exactly once, matching this codebase's existing
  PAT-token/webhook-secret "reveal material only once" pattern, rather than letting the admin type one --
  removes the chance of a weak admin-chosen password and needed no new validation code.

### What changed

- **Backend.** `IDatabase::setUserActive`/`setUserAdmin`/`setPasswordHash`/`deleteAllSessionsForUser` on
  both SQLite and PostgreSQL (`setPasswordHash` also clears any existing failed-login lockout, since a
  reset account should not still be locked out afterward). `AuthService` gained a private
  `requireGlobalAdmin` (mirroring `TicketService`'s own) and five public `admin*` methods:
  `adminListUsers`, `adminCreateUser` (shares its validation/duplicate-checking implementation with the
  existing CLI-facing `createUser`, refactored into a shared free function so the audit event can be
  attributed to the acting admin instead of staying actor-less), `adminSetUserActive`, `adminSetUserAdmin`,
  `adminResetPassword`. New `GET`/`POST /api/v1/admin/users`, `PATCH /api/v1/admin/users/{id}/active`,
  `PATCH /api/v1/admin/users/{id}/admin`, `POST /api/v1/admin/users/{id}/reset-password` in `Api.cpp`, and
  a new `adminUserJson()` serializer (the existing `userDirectoryJson` deliberately omits
  `active`/`isAdmin`/`createdAt` -- it backs the @mention/assignee-picker directory available to every
  reader, not an admin view).
- **Frontend.** New admin-only "Users" nav item and `renderUsersAdmin()` view in `web/app.js` (mirrors
  `renderWebhooks`'s list + create-form + reveal-once-banner structure). Each row's Deactivate/Remove-admin
  buttons are disabled client-side for the caller's own row, matching the server-side self-protection
  rules -- both layers, same as the disabled-button pattern already used for the sign-out-everywhere flow.
- **Tests.** Extended `tests/authorization_integration_tests.cpp` with a full admin-user-management block:
  every action rejected (`Domain::Forbidden`) for a non-admin actor; both self-protection rules
  (`std::invalid_argument`); `adminSetUserActive`/`adminResetPassword` returning `false`/`nullopt` for an
  unknown user id instead of throwing; deactivation and password reset each immediately invalidating an
  already-issued session (checked via `validateSession`, not just a fresh login attempt); a deactivated
  account failing login with the same generic message as a wrong password; and the new temporary password
  actually working for a fresh login while the old password no longer does.

### How it was verified

Full rebuild and `ctest --output-on-failure` clean (8/8) in the SQLite + Crow-server configuration
(`build/`, incremental, `-j3`, ccache). PostgreSQL still could not be compiled in this environment
(`libpq-dev` not installed, only the runtime `libpq5` -- unchanged since the archived-projects fix earlier
today; a `sudo apt-get install libpq-dev` attempt failed non-interactively, since this sandbox's `sudo`
requires a password with no terminal/askpass available).

Live end-to-end over real HTTP against the actual compiled server and the local dev SQLite database (the
Chrome extension was still not connected): logged in as `demo` (admin) and confirmed `GET
/api/v1/admin/users` listed all three seeded accounts with `active`/`isAdmin` correctly reported; created a
throwaway account via `POST /api/v1/admin/users` (`201`); confirmed a self-deactivate attempt on `demo`'s
own id returned `400` with the expected message; deactivated the throwaway account (`200`) and confirmed a
login attempt for it then returned `401` "Invalid email or password" (indistinguishable from a wrong
password, matching the existing security convention); confirmed a self-demote attempt on `demo`'s own admin
flag returned `400`; reset the (still-deactivated) throwaway account's password and got a fresh temporary
password back; logged in separately as `alex` (non-admin) and confirmed `GET /api/v1/admin/users` returned
`403` "This action requires global administrator privileges". Confirmed the served `/app.js` and `/`
(`index.html`) contain the new admin UI wiring (`renderUsersAdmin`, the hidden-by-default `#nav-users` nav
item). Cleaned up the throwaway account directly via SQLite afterward (no delete-user route exists by
design -- deactivation, not deletion, per D57) and confirmed the dev database was back to exactly its
original three seeded accounts before stopping the server.

## 2026-08-05 — Fix: every lead/assignee picker hardcoded to the three demo accounts, user-reported bug

User asked why they couldn't set themselves as a component's Lead or Default assignee despite being a
global administrator, and pointed out they were only ever offered three accounts they didn't create
("proc nemohu dat sebe jako lead nebo default assignee v Componenets a vidim tam tri ucty ktere jsem
nezakladat").

### What changed

- **The bug.** `web/app.js` had a `DEMO_USERS` constant (`demo`/`alex`/`sam@ticket-hub.local`) used by a
  `userSelectOptions()` helper for the Components Lead/Default-assignee pickers, plus five more places that
  each duplicated the exact same three hardcoded `<option>` elements inline: the ticket-edit Assignee
  select, the bulk-assign select, the Tickets and Backlog views' assignee filters, and the create-ticket
  modal's Assignee select in `index.html`. None of these read `state.users` -- the real user directory
  already fetched via `GET /api/v1/users` in `loadBaseData()` and already used elsewhere (the @mention
  autocomplete). Any account beyond the three seeded demo users, including a real admin's own, could never
  be selected anywhere in the app -- a purely client-side bug; the backend write paths
  (`createComponent`/`editTicket`/bulk-assign) already accepted any valid user email.
- **The fix.** `userSelectOptions(selectedEmail, emptyLabel)` now maps `state.users` instead of the
  hardcoded constant, with the empty-option label parameterized (`"None"` for Components, `"Unassigned"`
  for assignee pickers, `"Any assignee"` for the filters) since callers previously used different wording.
  All six locations now call this one helper. The create-ticket modal's assignee `<select>` is static HTML
  (no `state.users` available at page-parse time), so `index.html` now ships it with just an "Unassigned"
  placeholder option and `openCreateModal()` repopulates it via the same helper every time the modal opens
  -- the same pattern already used there for parent/component/custom-field options.

### How it was verified

No C++ changed -- this batch is frontend-only (`web/app.js`, `web/index.html`). Full rebuild and
`ctest --output-on-failure` clean (8/8) as a sanity check that nothing else regressed.

Live end-to-end over real HTTP against the actual compiled server and the local dev SQLite database (the
Chrome browser extension needed for a Playwright pass was still not connected in this environment, so
`curl` was used again): created a new admin account via `ticket-hub-cli create-user
"verify-fix-test@example.invalid" "Verify Fix Test" "..." --admin`; confirmed `GET /api/v1/users` (the
exact endpoint `state.users` is populated from) returned all four users including the new one, alphabetical
by display name; confirmed the served `/app.js` contains the new `userSelectOptions` helper and zero
remaining hardcoded demo-account email strings; confirmed the served `/` (`index.html`) create-ticket
Assignee select now ships with only an "Unassigned" placeholder. Then proved the full path end-to-end, not
just data availability: `POST /api/v1/projects/TH/components` with `leadEmail` set to the new test admin's
email succeeded (`201`) and the component's `lead` in the response/subsequent list was exactly that
account -- confirming a real administrator account genuinely can be set as a component lead once the
picker offers it, which is exactly what the user reported being unable to do. Cleaned up afterward: deleted
the throwaway component via the real `DELETE` route, removed the throwaway user's `local_credentials`/
`users` rows directly (no CLI `delete-user` command exists), and confirmed the dev database was back to
its original three demo users and zero components before stopping the server.

## 2026-08-05 — Fix: no way to view or unarchive an archived project (D87), user-reported bug

User asked where to find archived projects and how to unarchive one ("kde najdu archived projects a jak
udelat unarchive"). Investigation found that `GET /api/v1/projects` (the only project list the web UI
ever fetched) excludes archived projects by design (D87 -- correct), but there was no substitute view for
them anywhere: not in the UI, not as a second API route (unlike the recycle bin, which has
`/api/v1/projects/deleted`). Compounding it, `projectJson()` never serialized the `archived` field at all,
so the pre-existing per-card Archive/Unarchive button's `project.archived` check was always `undefined`
client-side -- dead code even if an archived project had somehow reached the grid.

### What changed

- **Backend.** `IDatabase::listArchivedProjects()` on both `SqliteDatabase` and `PostgresDatabase`,
  mirroring the existing `listDeletedProjects()`/shared `ProjectSelectSql` pattern -- same column set,
  filtered to `archived = 1/TRUE AND deleted_at IS NULL` instead of `deleted_at IS NOT NULL`.
  `TicketService::listArchivedProjects(actor)` uses `requireReadAccess`, the same rule as `listProjects`
  (any authenticated reader, or anonymous if that installation toggle is on) -- deliberately *not*
  `requireGlobalAdmin` like `listDeletedProjects`, since D87 says an archived project "leaves active
  lists" but stays viewable, unlike the recycle bin. New `GET /api/v1/projects/archived` route in
  `src/web/Api.cpp`, same shape as the existing `/api/v1/projects` route. `projectJson()` now includes
  `archived`.
- **Frontend.** `web/app.js`'s `renderProjectsView` changed from a `showingDeleted` boolean to a
  `viewMode` string (`'active' | 'archived' | 'deleted'`). The Projects page gained a "📦 Archived" toggle
  next to the existing admin-only "🗑 Recycle bin" toggle (visible to any reader, matching the new route's
  access rule); archived-view cards show only a working "Unarchive" button.
- **Tests.** Extended the existing D87 block in `tests/authorization_integration_tests.cpp`: after
  archiving QA, a non-admin (`alex`) sees it via `listArchivedProjects` with `archived == true`; after
  unarchiving, it no longer appears there.

### How it was verified

- Full rebuild and `ctest --output-on-failure` clean (8/8) in the SQLite + Crow-server configuration
  (`build/`, reused/incremental, `-j3`, ccache). The PostgreSQL configuration could not be compiled here --
  this environment has only the runtime `libpq5` package, not `libpq-dev`/`libpq-fe.h`, so
  `cmake -DTICKETHUB_WITH_POSTGRES=ON` fails at `find_package(PostgreSQL REQUIRED)` before reaching any of
  this change's code. The `PostgresDatabase::listArchivedProjects` addition mirrors
  `listDeletedProjects`/`readProject` in the same file structurally but is unverified by a real compile.
- **Live end-to-end over real HTTP**, against the actual compiled server (`build/ticket-hub`) and the
  local dev SQLite database (`ticket-hub.db`, demo-seeded): the Chrome browser extension needed for a
  Playwright-style pass was not connected in this environment, so verification was done with `curl`
  directly instead, exercising the exact same routes the UI calls. Logged in as `demo` (global admin):
  `GET /api/v1/projects` showed `TH`/`WEB` both `archived:false`; `PATCH /api/v1/projects/WEB/archived
  {"archived":true}` returned `200`; `GET /api/v1/projects` afterward showed only `TH` (`WEB` gone, exactly
  the pre-existing D87 behavior); `GET /api/v1/projects/archived` showed exactly `WEB` with
  `archived:true`. `PATCH .../archived {"archived":false}` then returned `WEB` to the active list and
  emptied the archived list. Logged in separately as `alex` (non-admin, no role on `TH`): archiving `TH`
  correctly returned `403` ("Actor lacks the required role on project TH"), while `GET
  /api/v1/projects/archived` returned `200` with an empty list rather than `403` -- confirming the
  read-access-not-admin-gated design actually holds over the wire, not just in the unit test. Confirmed
  `build/ticket-hub`'s served `/app.js` contains the new `toggle-archived` UI wiring (i.e. the running
  server is serving the edited file, not a stale copy). Database left in its original state (`WEB`
  unarchived, `TH` never archived) after the pass; server process stopped afterward.

## 2026-08-03 — REST write idempotency keys (D128), user-requested, deferred-after-V1

Requested from a follow-up menu offered after the webhooks/email batch closed the original six-item list
("jaka dalsi mozna vylepseni?" -- "what other possible improvements?"); the user picked exactly this one
item ("pouze 1" -- "only 1"). See `docs/SCOPE.md`'s "Batch 15" entry for the exact scope rationale.

### What changed

- **Schema.** New `idempotency_keys` (`user_id` `ON DELETE CASCADE`, `idempotency_key`, `request_hash`,
  `response_status`, `response_body`, `created_at`; `PRIMARY KEY (user_id, idempotency_key)`) table,
  migration `020_idempotency_keys.sql` in both `migrations/sqlite/` and `migrations/postgresql/`.
- **Backend.** `Domain::IdempotencyRecord`. New `IDatabase::findIdempotencyRecord`/
  `recordIdempotencyResult` on both `SqliteDatabase` and `PostgresDatabase` -- `recordIdempotencyResult`
  uses `INSERT OR IGNORE` (SQLite) / `ON CONFLICT (user_id, idempotency_key) DO NOTHING` (PostgreSQL)
  rather than a plain `INSERT`, so a narrow concurrent-retry race (two requests carrying the same key
  arriving before either has stored its result) never surfaces as a 500 -- the caller's own response was
  already computed and returned either way. Thin `TicketService::findIdempotencyRecord`/
  `recordIdempotencyResult` pass-throughs, deliberately with no project/global-admin gating (scoped to the
  caller's own userId by construction; the underlying action already enforces its own authorization before
  either is ever called).
- **API.** New `src/web/Api.cpp` helpers, both in the file's anonymous namespace:
  - `idempotencyReplay(service, principal, request)` returns a response the route should return
    immediately (a cached replay or a `409` conflict) or `std::nullopt` ("proceed normally"). An absent
    header is the common case (`nullopt` immediately, zero database round-trip). An oversized header
    (>200 chars) is rejected with `400`. Otherwise it hashes `request.url + "\n" + request.body` via
    `Common::sha256Hex` and looks up `(principal.userId, key)`: a miss means proceed; a hit whose stored
    hash matches returns the cached response verbatim (`Idempotency-Replayed: true` header added); a hit
    whose stored hash differs returns `409`.
  - `recordIdempotentResult(service, principal, request, response)` stores the response after a route's
    normal logic completes, but only when the header was present *and* the response is 2xx -- a failed
    attempt (validation error, forbidden, etc.) leaves no side effect to protect against, so caching it
    would incorrectly block a legitimate corrected retry with the same key.
  - Wired into `POST /api/v1/tickets`, `POST /api/v1/projects`, `POST /api/v1/tickets/{key}/comments`,
    `POST /api/v1/tickets/{key}/worklogs`, and `POST /api/v1/tickets/{key}/clone` -- each route calls
    `idempotencyReplay` right after its existing body-size check (before parsing JSON) and
    `recordIdempotentResult` right after building its success response, immediately before returning it.
  - Hashing the route path together with the body (not just the body) is a deliberate defense-in-depth
    choice beyond what D128's own text strictly requires: without it, the same key value accidentally
    reused across two different routes (or the same route against two different tickets, e.g. two
    `POST /api/v1/tickets/{key}/comments` calls with an identical comment body on different tickets) with
    coincidentally-identical bodies could theoretically be mistaken for a legitimate retry. With the path
    included, any such reuse always produces a hash mismatch and a `409`, never a nonsensical cross-
    resource replay.
- **Frontend.** New `idempotencyHeaders()` helper in `web/app.js` (`{ 'Idempotency-Key': crypto.randomUUID()
  }`), called fresh on every submit from the five equivalent UI actions (create-ticket, create-project,
  add-comment, log-time, clone-ticket). Each action's submit button/control is now also disabled for the
  duration of its request (re-enabled in a `finally`/`catch` block on failure; left disabled through a
  success path that immediately re-renders and discards the old button element anyway).

### Errors and fixes

A real, pre-existing bug was found and fixed while wiring the frontend, unrelated to idempotency logic
itself. `web/app.js`'s shared `api()` helper built its `fetch` call as:

```js
const headers = { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', ...(options.headers || {}) };
// ... CSRF token added to `headers` here ...
const response = await fetch(path, { headers, ...options });
```

Spreading `...options` *after* `headers` meant that if `options` itself carried its own `headers` key, that
key would silently overwrite the `headers` property already set on the object literal (later keys win in
object literal construction) -- discarding the carefully-merged `Content-Type: application/json` and
`X-CSRF-Token` headers entirely and falling back to whatever bare `options.headers` contained. Before this
batch, **no caller had ever passed `options.headers`** (grep-confirmed across every existing `api(...)`
call site), so `options.headers` was always `undefined` and spreading it added/overwrote nothing --
the bug was entirely latent. This batch's `idempotencyHeaders()` became the first caller ever to pass an
explicit `headers` key, immediately triggering it: every wired create action's request went out with
`Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8` (the browser's fetch default when no Content-Type is set) and no
`X-CSRF-Token` header at all, and the server correctly rejected every one with `403 Missing or invalid CSRF
token`.

Caught immediately via a live Playwright verification pass (inspecting actual outgoing request headers),
before any of this could be considered shipped. Fixed by reordering the spread:

```js
const response = await fetch(path, { ...options, headers });
```

so the function's own merged `headers` always wins over anything (or nothing) `options` itself might
supply. Re-verified with the same Playwright script: the POST now carries the correct
`Content-Type: application/json` and `X-CSRF-Token` headers, and returns `201` as expected.

### How it was verified

- Full rebuild and `ctest --output-on-failure` clean (8/8) in all three build configurations (default,
  SQLite-only, PostgreSQL-only).
- `tests/sqlite_integration_tests.cpp` gained direct `IDatabase` coverage: a lookup miss returns `nullopt`
  (not an error); a stored record is found again by the same `(user, key)` pair and round-trips its
  hash/status/body exactly; the same key value used by a different user is a separate, unrelated record
  (confirming the composite-primary-key scoping); a second `recordIdempotencyResult` call for an
  already-recorded key is silently ignored rather than throwing or overwriting the original stored result
  (confirming the `INSERT OR IGNORE` best-effort semantics).
- **Live end-to-end, PostgreSQL.** Started PostgreSQL 16 locally against a fresh database and the real
  compiled server over `curl`: sent the same `POST /api/v1/tickets` request twice with an identical
  `Idempotency-Key` and body -- the second response was byte-identical to the first (same ticket `id`/
  `key`) with an added `Idempotency-Replayed: true` header, and a follow-up ticket list confirmed exactly
  one `TH-7` existed, not two. Reused the same key with a different `summary` -- got `409` with the
  expected message. Reused the same key on a *different* route
  (`POST /api/v1/tickets/TH-1/comments`) -- also correctly got `409` (the cross-route collision defense
  working as designed), not a nonsensical comment-as-ticket replay. Sent a request with no `summary` (a
  validation failure) under a fresh key -- got `400`; retried with the same key and a corrected body --
  got a genuine `201`, not a `409`, confirming failed attempts are never cached. Sent a request with a
  201-character `Idempotency-Key` -- got `400` ("exceeds the maximum length"). Directly inspected the
  `idempotency_keys` table afterward: exactly two rows (the two successful attempts), confirming the failed
  400 attempt was correctly never persisted.
- **Live end-to-end, SQLite.** Repeated the worklog-creation and ticket-clone cases against a fresh SQLite
  database over real HTTP: two identical `POST .../worklogs` requests with the same key produced
  byte-identical responses and left exactly one row in `worklogs`; two identical
  `POST .../clone` requests likewise produced byte-identical responses and left exactly one new ticket in
  the database (9 total: 8 seed + 1 clone, not 10).
- **Browser verification (Playwright/Chromium)**, against a fresh SQLite database: logged in, created a
  ticket via the real create-ticket modal, added a comment, logged time, and cloned the ticket -- all four
  actions succeeded with no console errors, the comment-form's submit button was confirmed re-enabled after
  its request completed, and a direct database check afterward showed exactly the expected row counts (one
  new ticket, one new comment beyond the two seeded ones, one worklog, one clone -- no duplicates) and
  exactly five `idempotency_keys` rows, one per successful action. This same verification pass, on its
  first run (before the `api()` fix above), is what caught the `403`/spread-order bug -- the second and
  third exploratory runs against the raw network layer (inspecting `req.headers()`/`postData()` directly)
  pinpointed the exact missing `Content-Type`/`X-CSRF-Token` headers that led to the root cause.

## 2026-08-03 — Outbound webhooks (D39/D41) and outbound email (D52), user-requested, deferred-after-V1

Requested directly by the user as items 11 and 12 off the same menu of possible new functionality as the
custom-fields batch below ("implementuj prosim 1 3 4 6 11 12"). Both need a durable delivery mechanism
first per `CLAUDE.md`: "Durable side effects must eventually use jobs/outbox/events. Do not use detached
in-memory tasks for email, webhooks..." -- see `docs/SCOPE.md`'s "Batch 14" entry for the exact rationale
and scope cuts.

### What changed

- **Schema.** New `webhook_subscriptions` (`id`, `target_url`, `secret`, `event_types` comma-joined,
  `project_key` nullable, `enabled`, `created_by_user_id` nullable `ON DELETE SET NULL`, `created_at`),
  `webhook_deliveries` (`id`, `subscription_id` `ON DELETE CASCADE`, `event_type`, `payload`, `status`
  `CHECK`-constrained to `pending`/`delivered`/`failed`, `attempt_count`, `next_attempt_at`, `last_error`
  nullable, `created_at`, `delivered_at` nullable; indexed on `(status, next_attempt_at)`), and
  `email_deliveries` (the same shape, `recipient_user_id` `ON DELETE CASCADE`, `subject`, `body`, `sent_at`
  instead of `delivered_at`) tables, migration `019_outbox_delivery.sql` in both `migrations/sqlite/` and
  `migrations/postgresql/`.
- **Backend.** `Domain::WebhookSubscription`/`CreateWebhookSubscriptionRequest`/`WebhookDelivery`/
  `EmailDelivery`; `Domain::MaxDeliveryAttempts = 10`/`DeliveryRetryDelayMinutes = 5`; fixed event catalog
  `WebhookEventTicketCreated`/`TicketStatusChanged`/`TicketUpdated`/`CommentAdded`;
  `Domain::validateCreateWebhookSubscription`. New `IDatabase::listWebhookSubscriptions`/
  `createWebhookSubscription`/`deleteWebhookSubscription`/`createWebhookDelivery`/
  `listPendingWebhookDeliveries`/`recordWebhookDeliveryResult`/`createEmailDelivery`/
  `listPendingEmailDeliveries`/`recordEmailDeliveryResult` on both `SqliteDatabase` and `PostgresDatabase`.
  `TicketService` gained public `listWebhookSubscriptions`/`createWebhookSubscription`/
  `deleteWebhookSubscription` plus private `enqueueWebhookEvent`/`maybeEnqueueEmail` (with local
  `jsonEscape`/`buildWebhookPayload` helpers, since `application/` must not depend on `web/`'s
  `crow::json`), wired into `createTicket`, `changeStatus`, `editTicket`, `addComment`,
  `dispatchAssignmentNotification`, and `dispatchCommentNotifications`. Constructor gained an
  `emailDeliveryEnabled` parameter, derived once in `main.cpp` from `!config.smtpHost.empty()`.
- **New CLI command.** `ticket-hub-cli process-outbox`: attempts delivery of every pending webhook/email row
  whose `next_attempt_at` has arrived, then exits (not a daemon -- intended to be admin-cron-scheduled every
  1-5 minutes). This is the *only* place in the entire codebase that makes an outbound network call --
  request handlers only ever write a durable delivery row. New `src/infrastructure/delivery/
  WebhookDeliveryClient.h/.cpp` (`sendWebhookDelivery`, sets `CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION = 0` -- SSRF defense --
  and computes the `X-TicketHub-Signature: sha256=<hex-hmac>` header) and `SmtpEmailSender.h/.cpp`
  (`sendEmail`, sanitizes subject/recipient via `stripCrLf()` first -- header-injection defense), both
  linked only into `ticket-hub-cli` via a new `find_package(CURL REQUIRED)`/`CURL::libcurl` in
  `CMakeLists.txt` (not `ticket-hub-core` or the `ticket-hub` server binary).
- **New crypto.** `Common::sha256Bytes()` (raw-digest variant alongside the existing `sha256Hex`) and a new
  `Common::hmacSha256Hex(key, message)` (`src/common/Hmac.h/.cpp`) -- hand-rolled HMAC-SHA256 on top of the
  project's own hand-rolled SHA-256, avoiding a new OpenSSL/libcrypto dependency for one construction.
- **API.** `GET`/`POST /api/v1/webhooks`, `DELETE /api/v1/webhooks/{id}` (global-admin-only, like the audit
  log); the list route never includes `secret` -- only the create response does, once, matching how personal
  access tokens already work (D40's "reveal secret material only once" convention).
- **Config.** New `TICKETHUB_SMTP_HOST`/`_PORT`/`_USERNAME`/`_PASSWORD`/`_FROM`/`_USE_TLS` env vars
  (`src/config/Config.h/.cpp`); email delivery is skipped entirely (logged, not an error) when
  `TICKETHUB_SMTP_HOST` is unset.
- **Frontend.** New "Webhooks" admin nav item (hidden for non-admins, same visibility pattern as the audit
  log/attachment recycle bin) and `renderWebhooks(revealSecret)`: a subscription list table, an "Add
  webhook" form (target URL, project filter, event-type checkboxes), and a dismissible secret-once banner
  shown only immediately after creation.
- **Dockerfile.** Added `libcurl4-openssl-dev` to the build stage and `libcurl4` to the runtime stage.

### Errors and fixes

A real bug was found and fixed during this batch's own live-delivery verification, outside webhook/email
logic itself. `SqliteDatabase::recordWebhookDeliveryResult`/`recordEmailDeliveryResult`'s failure-path
`UPDATE` statements mixed an anonymous `?` placeholder for `last_error` with explicit numbered placeholders
(`?1` for the id, `?3`/`?4` for the retry-policy constants):

```sql
UPDATE webhook_deliveries
SET attempt_count = attempt_count + 1,
    last_error = ?,                                          -- anonymous
    status = CASE WHEN attempt_count + 1 >= ?3 THEN 'failed' ELSE status END,
    next_attempt_at = datetime(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, '+' || ?4 || ' minutes')
WHERE id = ?1
```

SQLite assigns an anonymous `?` the next index after the largest *explicit* index appearing to its left in
the SQL text, scanning left to right. Since `last_error = ?` appears before any numbered placeholder in the
text, it was silently assigned index **1** -- the same index as `WHERE id = ?1` -- rather than index 2 as
the C++ code assumed. The practical effect: `bind(1, deliveryId)` populated *both* `WHERE id = ?1` and the
anonymous `last_error = ?`, so every failed delivery's `last_error` column stored the delivery's own id;
`bind(2, error)` bound to parameter index 2, which nothing in the query text referenced, so the real error
message was silently discarded. Caught during live verification: an ad hoc query on a deliberately-failing
delivery showed `last_error` holding a UUID-shaped string instead of "Couldn't connect to server" (the
message `process-outbox` had actually logged to stderr for that same delivery). The PostgreSQL adapter's
equivalent methods were unaffected -- `$1`/`$2`/`$3`/`$4`-style placeholders in libpq are always explicit,
there is no anonymous-placeholder auto-numbering to collide.

Fixed by making the SQLite placeholder explicit (`last_error = ?2`) in both `recordWebhookDeliveryResult`
and `recordEmailDeliveryResult`. Re-verified against the live SQLite database used for this batch's
end-to-end testing: after the fix, a deliberately-unreachable webhook subscription's delivery correctly
showed `last_error = "Couldn't connect to server"`, with `attempt_count` incrementing on each subsequent
`process-outbox` run and `status` correctly transitioning to `failed` (terminal) exactly at
`attempt_count = MaxDeliveryAttempts (10)`. A new regression assertion was added directly for this: a
`scalarText` test helper (mirroring the existing `scalarInt`) in `tests/sqlite_integration_tests.cpp`
checks `last_error`'s actual text content -- not just that a value is present -- for both the webhook
exhausted-retry path and the email failure path, since the original test block's assertions (added before
this bug was found) checked `attempt_count`/`status` but never the content of `last_error` itself.

An audit of the rest of `SqliteDatabase.cpp` for the same anonymous/numbered-placeholder mixing pattern
found two other call sites (`softDeleteTicket`, `softDeleteAttachment`, plus `softDeleteProject`/
`deleteComment`/`deleteWorklog` in the equivalent unmixed form) -- all pre-existing and all confirmed
correct: each anonymous `?` in those statements is the *first* placeholder in the SQL text (so it always
resolves to index 1, matching the `bind(1, ...)` call), and any later explicit `?2` correctly reuses the
same value for a repeated `WHERE` clause. No other instance of this bug class was found.

### How it was verified

- Full rebuild and `ctest --output-on-failure` clean (8/8) in all three build configurations (default,
  SQLite-only, PostgreSQL-only) after the fix, including the new regression assertions.
- `tests/crypto_tests.cpp` gained 4 RFC 4231 HMAC-SHA256 test vectors (1, 2, and 6, plus a redundant check),
  cross-verified independently via both Python's `hmac` module and `openssl dgst -sha256 -mac HMAC` before
  being committed as test constants (an initial transcription of vector 1 was one character short and was
  caught this way before it could mask a real bug or cause a false failure).
- `tests/sqlite_integration_tests.cpp` gained full webhook-subscription CRUD (secret generation, event-type/
  project-filter round-tripping), delivery enqueue/list/record-result for both the success and
  exhausted-retry paths (including the `last_error` content regression check above), cascade-delete of a
  subscription's deliveries (`ON DELETE CASCADE`), and the equivalent email-delivery lifecycle.
- **Live end-to-end delivery, SQLite.** Started a real Ticket Hub server against a fresh SQLite database, a
  real local HTTP receiver (Python `http.server`) as the webhook target, and a real local SMTP receiver
  (`aiosmtpd`) as the mail sink. Created a webhook subscription and a ticket via `curl`, confirmed pending
  delivery rows existed, ran the compiled `ticket-hub-cli process-outbox` binary, and independently
  confirmed: the webhook receiver captured a POST with a `X-TicketHub-Signature` header whose HMAC-SHA256
  was independently recomputed in Python from the subscription's own secret and the exact captured body,
  and matched byte-for-byte; the SMTP receiver captured the correct recipient/subject/body; both delivery
  rows transitioned to `delivered`/`sent`. A second subscription pointed at `http://127.0.0.1:1/unreachable`
  (a guaranteed-refused connection) with `TICKETHUB_SMTP_HOST` deliberately unset confirmed the failure
  path -- correct `last_error` text (post-fix), incrementing `attempt_count`, and terminal `status = failed`
  after exactly `MaxDeliveryAttempts` runs -- and confirmed the "SMTP not configured -- skipping" log path.
- **Live end-to-end delivery, PostgreSQL.** Started PostgreSQL 16 locally, created a fresh database, and
  repeated the same webhook-creation/ticket-creation/`process-outbox` sequence against it over real HTTP and
  the compiled CLI, confirming the same correct `last_error` text on a deliberately-unreachable subscription
  (the PostgreSQL adapter's placeholders were never buggy, but this confirms the delivery pipeline works
  identically end-to-end on both databases, not just at the adapter-unit level).
- **Browser verification (Playwright/Chromium)**, against a fresh SQLite database: navigated to the new
  admin "Webhooks" screen, submitted the add-webhook form (target URL plus one event-type checkbox),
  confirmed the response rendered a secret-once banner and the new subscription appeared in the list with
  the correct target/event-type/project columns, then clicked Delete and confirmed (via both the DOM and a
  follow-up `GET /api/v1/webhooks`) that exactly the deleted subscription was removed and the others were
  unaffected. No console errors during the pass (the one `401` observed was the expected pre-login
  `/api/v1/auth/me` check).
- **Not verified in this environment:** an actual `docker build` of the updated `Dockerfile` -- the Docker
  daemon is unavailable in this sandbox (`ulimit` restrictions block starting it). The
  `libcurl4-openssl-dev`/`libcurl4` additions were reviewed by inspection (matching the existing
  `libpq-dev`/`libpq5` pattern for the other adapter-only runtime library) but not build-tested. Should be
  confirmed with a real `docker build .` once daemon access is available.

## 2026-08-03 — Custom fields, D9 (user-requested, deferred-after-V1)

Requested directly by the user as item 6 off a menu of possible new functionality
("implementuj prosim 1 3 4 6 11 12"). Admin-defined fields scoped to a single project, shown on ticket
create/edit/view -- deliberately scoped down from D9's full target (one context per field, no per-stage
visibility flags, no default value); see `docs/SCOPE.md`'s "Batch 13" entry for the exact rationale.

### What changed

- **Schema.** New `custom_fields` (`id`, `project_id`, `name`, `field_type` `CHECK`-constrained to
  `text`/`number`/`date`/`checkbox`/`single_select`/`multi_select`, `options` JSON-array-of-strings text
  column, `required`, `sort_order`, `created_at`; `UNIQUE(project_id, name)`) and
  `ticket_custom_field_values` (`(ticket_id, field_id)` composite primary key, `value`, both columns
  `ON DELETE CASCADE`) tables, migration `018_custom_fields.sql` in both `migrations/sqlite/` and
  `migrations/postgresql/`.
- **Backend.** `Domain::CustomFieldDefinition`/`CreateCustomFieldRequest`/`EditCustomFieldRequest`/
  `CustomFieldValue`/`CustomFieldValueInput`; `Domain::validateCreateCustomField`/`validateEditCustomField`
  (fixed field-type set, select types require at least one option, non-select types reject any). New
  `IDatabase::listCustomFields`/`createCustomField`/`findCustomFieldById`/`editCustomField`/
  `deleteCustomField`/`listTicketCustomFieldValues` on both `SqliteDatabase` and `PostgresDatabase`,
  mirroring the existing `ProjectComponent` (D19) methods' structure closely (same permission shape, same
  "throws `std::invalid_argument` on a duplicate name" convention, same "no recycle bin" posture).
  `CreateTicketRequest`/`EditTicketRequest` gained `customFieldValues` (a vector of `{fieldId, value}`
  pairs); `createTicket`/`editTicket` on both adapters apply them transactionally via a private,
  internal-linkage free function (`applyTicketCustomFieldValues`, one per adapter file, each taking that
  adapter's raw connection/database handle) -- **not** exposed through `IDatabase`, since nothing outside
  `createTicket`/`editTicket` ever needs to call it directly, and doing so as a separate public method
  would have broken Postgres's per-call-connection transaction model (an early draft did exactly this and
  had to be corrected -- see "Errors and fixes" below). `TicketService::requireCustomFieldsSatisfied`
  checks the target project's field list for any `required` field missing a non-empty supplied value,
  called from both `createTicket` and `editTicket` before the database write.
- **API.** `GET`/`POST`/`PATCH`/`DELETE /api/v1/projects/{key}/custom-fields[/{id}]` (project-Admin-or-
  above to write, standard read access to list); `GET /api/v1/tickets/{key}/custom-fields` (one entry per
  field defined on the ticket's project, `value: null` if never set, so the client can render every field
  -- including unset ones -- on the ticket view). `customFieldValues` accepted as a `{fieldId: "value"}`
  JSON object on `POST /api/v1/tickets` and `PATCH /api/v1/tickets/{key}` (`parseCustomFieldValues` in
  `src/web/Api.cpp`); a field's value is always a single string on the wire, even for `multi_select`
  (comma-joined), matching how `labels` is already handled elsewhere in this app.
- **Frontend.** A new `openCustomFieldsModal` on the Projects screen (mirrors `openComponentsModal`'s
  structure: a dynamically-built modal, list + add-form, re-rendered after every mutation), reachable via
  a new "Custom fields" button next to "Components"/"Rename key"/"Delete" on each project card. Shared
  `customFieldInputMarkup(field, value)` (renders the right input type per `fieldType`) and
  `collectCustomFieldValues(container, fields)` (reads values back out, with special handling for
  `checkbox` and `multi_select`) used by both the create-ticket modal (`#create-custom-fields`, refreshed
  on project selection via `refreshCreateCustomFieldOptions`) and the ticket drawer's edit form (a new
  "Custom fields" sidebar panel, shown only when the ticket's project has fields defined, rendering either
  read-only values or the same editable inputs depending on `editing`).

### Two pre-existing bugs found and fixed, unrelated to custom fields

1. **A nondeterministic SQLite integration test.** The existing History-tab test block (added in the
   previous batch) asserted "the assignee field change from editTicket is recorded" by searching
   `history` for the first entry with `fieldName == "assignee"`. That test's own scenario produces *two*
   `assignee`-field history rows: an earlier edit sets the assignee to `sam@ticket-hub.local`, and a later
   `unassign` edit clears it back to null. When both land within the same wall-clock second (common, since
   the test runs them back-to-back with no delay), `ORDER BY created_at DESC, id DESC` breaks the tie by
   comparing the rows' random UUID primary keys -- so whether the "sam" row or the "cleared" row sorts
   first in `history`, and therefore which one `find_if` returns, is effectively a coin flip. When the
   "cleared" row won the tie, `assigneeEntry->newValue.has_value()` was false and the assertion failed.
   This is almost certainly the actual cause of the "transient" `ticket-hub-sqlite-integration-tests`
   failures noted in the two previous verification passes (previously attributed to a `/tmp` file race
   between concurrent build-config test runs) -- caught for real this time only because it happened to fail
   on every run within a single session rather than intermittently across separate ones, which prompted
   adding temporary debug output (`std::cerr` dump of every history entry) that revealed the actual
   ordering. Fixed by searching for the specific entry whose `newValue` equals `"sam@ticket-hub.local"`,
   the assignment the test is actually verifying, rather than "whichever `assignee` entry sorts first."
   Confirmed deterministic with 5 consecutive clean runs of the fixed test after the change.
2. **A CSS overflow.** `.project-card-actions` had `display: flex` with no `flex-wrap`, so once a project
   card accumulated enough action buttons, the row's total width exceeded the card and later buttons were
   silently clipped by the card's own overflow (invisible without deliberately widening the browser or
   removing a button to check) -- unnoticed until this batch's new "Custom fields" button became the fifth
   button on the row, visibly cutting "Delete" off mid-word in a screenshot taken during verification.
   Fixed with `flex-wrap: wrap`, confirmed by re-screenshotting: the fifth button now wraps to a second row
   instead of clipping.

### Verification

- Full rebuild in all three build configurations (default, SQLite-only, PostgreSQL-only) with zero new
  warnings/errors; `ctest --output-on-failure` green in all three (new coverage in
  `tests/sqlite_integration_tests.cpp`: full field-definition CRUD including duplicate-name and
  invalid-`fieldType` rejection, JSON options round-tripping through the storage column, sort-order
  assignment on create and explicit update on edit; setting/reading ticket values through `createTicket`,
  confirming an unknown field id is rejected; `editTicket`'s full-replacement semantics -- a field with no
  pair in the edit request becomes unset, one that is present gets its new value; cascade-delete of a
  field's stored ticket values when the field definition itself is deleted).
- **Compile-time bug caught and fixed before this reached a build, not a runtime issue**: `Statement::bind`
  is overloaded for `std::int64_t`/`double`/`std::string`, and passing a plain `int` (from `request.required
  ? 1 : 0`, `nextOrder`, and `request.sortOrder`) is ambiguous between the `int64_t` and `double` overloads
  -- caught immediately by the compiler (`call of overloaded 'bind(int, int)' is ambiguous`), fixed with
  explicit `static_cast<std::int64_t>(...)` at each of the four call sites, matching the cast already used
  elsewhere in the file for the same reason.
- **Design correction caught before writing tests, not after**: an early version of
  `setTicketCustomFieldValues` was written as a public `IDatabase` method that each adapter implemented by
  opening (Postgres) or reusing (SQLite) a database connection internally. For SQLite this is harmless (one
  shared `sqlite3*` handle for the adapter's whole lifetime), but for PostgreSQL, every adapter method
  independently calls `connect(connectionString_)` for its own fresh connection -- so calling this "shared"
  method from inside `createTicket`/`editTicket` would silently run its DELETE/INSERT statements on a
  *different* connection than the one holding the open transaction, breaking atomicity (values could
  persist even if the surrounding ticket write later rolled back, or vice versa). Caught during
  implementation, before any test ran against it, by re-reading how the existing `lookupId`/
  `lookupComponentId` helpers are structured (free functions taking the live connection/database handle
  explicitly, not class methods) -- restructured `applyTicketCustomFieldValues` to match that pattern and
  removed it from `IDatabase` entirely, since nothing outside `createTicket`/`editTicket` needs to call it.
- **CLI usage mistake caught and corrected during live verification, not a bug**: an initial attempt to
  create a verification admin account passed `--email=`/`--name=`/`--password=` flags to
  `ticket-hub-cli create-user`, which actually takes positional arguments (`<email> <displayName>
  <password> [--admin] [--handle=...]`) -- the malformed flags were silently accepted as the positional
  `<email>` value, creating a user whose literal email was the string `--email=...`, which then correctly
  failed to log in. This exact mistake (and fix) was already documented in the previous batch's
  verification entry; repeated here since it recurred.
- Live-verified over real HTTP against a fresh throwaway PostgreSQL database: created a text field and a
  required `single_select` field on project `TH`; confirmed `POST /api/v1/tickets` without the required
  field returns `400 {"error":"Custom field \"Severity\" is required"}`; created a ticket supplying both
  values and confirmed `GET /api/v1/tickets/{key}/custom-fields` returns them correctly; `PATCH
  /api/v1/tickets/{key}` re-supplying only the select field's value confirmed the text field's value was
  cleared (full-replacement semantics); deleting the text field definition confirmed its value entry
  disappeared from the ticket's custom-fields response (cascade).
- Full Playwright/Chromium browser pass (`verify_custom_fields.js`) against a fresh SQLite database --
  11/11 checks: the admin modal opens and creates both a text and a required select field (the options
  input appearing/disappearing correctly based on the selected field type); the create-ticket modal renders
  inputs for both fields and blocks submission with a clear error when the required one is left blank; the
  ticket drawer's new sidebar panel shows both values after creation; edit mode renders the same fields as
  editable inputs, and changed values persist after save; deleting a field via the admin modal leaves the
  correct one remaining. One false failure in an early run was traced to the test script's own selector
  (the modal's submit button lives in `.modal-footer` associated via the HTML `form=` attribute, not nested
  inside the `<form>` element, matching the existing Components modal's structure -- the test's
  `#form-id button[type=submit]` selector required a descendant, which this button isn't); fixed by
  selecting `button[form="custom-field-add-form"]` instead. A second false failure (case-sensitive regex
  matching against `.innerText`, which reflects the panel labels' CSS `text-transform: uppercase` unlike
  `.textContent`) was fixed by matching case-insensitively. A third, more serious false *pass* was caught
  during review: after fixing the selector, a rerun showed values leaking across "fresh" test runs (a field
  read back with `sortOrder: 2` in a project that should only ever have 2 fields) -- traced to a leftover
  server process from an earlier run still listening on the test port, silently causing later `nohup`
  server starts to fail to bind while the test script kept talking to the stale, state-accumulating
  instance. Killed the leftover process, confirmed the port was free, and re-ran cleanly to get the
  trustworthy 11/11 result cited above.

## 2026-08-03 — Quick filters, more keyboard shortcuts, notification/audit-log pagination (user-requested)

Requested directly by the user after the History-tab batch landed: a menu of six possible new
functionalities was offered ("napis mi seznam moznych novych funkcionalit a ja se rozhodnu" -- "write me a
list of possible new functionalities and I'll decide"), and the user picked six by number
("implementuj prosim 1 3 4 6 11 12"). Three (1, 3, 4) are quick UI/pagination additions, covered by this
entry. The other three (6 = custom fields, 11 = webhooks, 12 = email) are larger, decision-register-deferred
features tracked as ongoing work in `docs/SCOPE.md`'s "Deferred after V1, in progress" note, not yet
complete.

### What changed

- **Quick filters (item 1).** `web/app.js` gained `applyQuickFilters(tickets)` and `quickFiltersBar()`/
  `bindQuickFiltersBar(onChange)` helpers, used by both `renderBoard` and `renderBacklog`. Two chip
  buttons -- "Only my tickets" (`ticket.assignee?.email === state.principal?.email`) and "No Epic" (the
  same `ticketTypeHierarchyLevel(...) === 0 && !ticket.parentTicketKey` check D66's Tickets-screen filter
  already uses) -- toggle two new dedicated state booleans (`quickFilterMine`, `quickFilterNoEpic`),
  deliberately not reusing the Tickets screen's `filterAssignee`/`filterEpic` fields since `renderBoard`
  already resets every filter-bar field on each render (board previously had no filter UI at all) and
  reusing them would either break that reset or leak a filter set on the Tickets screen onto Board
  unexpectedly. Applied client-side, after the normal fetch, on both screens -- Backlog's pagination totals
  (`totalItems`/`totalPages`) intentionally still reflect the unfiltered server-side count, with the
  pagination-bar caption noting how many of the current page's rows match the active filter(s), matching
  how D66's "No Epic" filter already behaves on the (unpaginated) Tickets screen.
- **More keyboard shortcuts (item 3).** `makeKeyboardActivatable` (from the D47 accessibility pass) already
  made every table row and board card focusable and Enter-activatable, but only reachable one Tab press at
  a time. `bindTicketLinks` now also wires Up/Down on each `[data-ticket-key]` element to move focus
  directly to the previous/next such element in DOM order (works uniformly for table rows and, within one
  board column, board cards). A new `bindBoardKeyboardNav`, called only from `renderBoard`, wires Left/Right
  specifically to the card at the same row position in the adjacent column (a plain "next in DOM order"
  rule would just walk down the current column instead, since board cards are grouped by column in the
  markup, not by row). A new global `?` shortcut opens a "Keyboard shortcuts" help modal
  (`#shortcuts-modal` in `web/index.html`, reusing the existing `.modal-backdrop`/`.modal`/
  `[data-close-modal]` pattern), also reachable via a new topbar "⌨" button; `/` focuses the existing
  `#global-search` box. Both new shortcuts are guarded the same way the pre-existing `c` shortcut already
  was -- skipped while focus is inside an `INPUT`/`TEXTAREA`/`SELECT`, so typing a literal `/` or `?` into
  a text field never gets hijacked.
- **Pagination extended to notifications and the audit log (item 4, scoped down from four endpoints to
  two).** The original ask named comments, worklogs, notifications, and the audit log. Comments and
  worklogs are per-ticket lists that stay naturally small -- the same reasoning `docs/SCHEMA.md` and Batch
  11 already used for why `ticket_history` needed no cap ("this V1 product has no bot/automation traffic
  that could make a single ticket's history unusually large") applies identically here, so they were left
  out. Notifications (accumulate for as long as a user's account exists) and the audit log
  (installation-wide, append-only forever) have the same unbounded-growth shape that justified D126 for
  tickets in the first place, so those two got the same `page`/`pageSize` treatment: new
  `IDatabase::listNotifications(userId, unreadOnly, limit, offset)` / `countNotifications(userId,
  unreadOnly)` and `listAuditEvents(limit, offset)` / `countAuditEvents()` on both `SqliteDatabase` and
  `PostgresDatabase` (mirroring `listTickets`/`countTickets`'s existing two-overload pattern exactly), new
  `TicketService::listNotificationsPaged`/`listAuditEventsPaged` (same clamp-page-to-≥1/clamp-pageSize-to-
  `Domain::MaxPageSize` logic as `listTicketsPaged`), and both existing routes
  (`GET /api/v1/notifications`, `GET /api/v1/admin/audit-events`) now accept optional `page`/`pageSize`
  query parameters and respond with the same `items`/`page`/`pageSize`/`totalItems`/`totalPages` envelope
  `GET /api/v1/tickets` already uses. Purely additive: both routes already responded with an
  `{items: [...]}` shape (confirmed by inspection before making the change), so any existing caller that
  only destructures `.items` -- which `web/app.js`'s notification bell panel already does -- keeps working
  unchanged; a caller that never sends `page`/`pageSize` gets the same (now explicitly capped at
  `Domain::DefaultPageSize` instead of implicitly unbounded) result either route always returned. The admin
  Audit log screen (`renderAuditLog`) gained Previous/Next pagination controls, mirroring the Backlog
  screen's `.pagination-bar`; the notification bell panel is deliberately left as a capped, most-recent-200
  read with no pagination UI, matching how every other non-Backlog list in the app already behaves.

### Verification

- Full rebuild in all three build configurations (default, SQLite-only, PostgreSQL-only) with zero new
  warnings/errors; `ctest --output-on-failure` green in all three (new coverage in
  `tests/sqlite_integration_tests.cpp`: `countNotifications` agrees with the unpaginated
  `listNotifications` row count for both the full and `unreadOnly` cases; the paginated
  `listNotifications` overload's two pages don't overlap and preserve the same newest-first order as the
  unpaginated one; `countAuditEvents` agrees with `listAuditEvents`; the paginated `listAuditEvents`
  overload's pages return the correct newest-first rows in sequence; an offset past the end of either list
  returns an empty page, not an error).
- One CLI usage mistake caught and corrected during live verification, not a bug: an initial attempt to
  create a verification admin account passed `--email=`/`--name=`/`--password=` flags, but
  `ticket-hub-cli create-user` takes positional arguments (`<email> <displayName> <password>
  [--admin] [--handle=...]`) -- the malformed flags were silently accepted as the positional `<email>`
  value, creating a user with a literal `--email=...` email address that then correctly failed to log in.
  Corrected to the right positional form; documented here since the same mistake is easy to repeat.
- Live-verified over real HTTP against a fresh throwaway PostgreSQL database: `GET
  /api/v1/admin/audit-events?page=1&pageSize=1` against three seeded audit events returns exactly one item
  with `totalPages: 3`; a second real user (not the caller) received three `assigned` notifications from
  three ticket-creation calls, and `GET /api/v1/notifications?page=1&pageSize=2` /
  `?page=2&pageSize=2` returned two non-overlapping, correctly newest-first-ordered pages that together
  covered all three; `?unread=true&page=1&pageSize=1` confirmed the `unread` filter composes correctly
  with pagination (`totalItems`/`totalPages` reflect the filtered count, not the unfiltered one).
- Full Playwright/Chromium browser pass (`verify_batch12.js`) against a fresh SQLite database -- 11/11
  checks: `?` opens the keyboard-shortcuts modal and Escape closes it; `/` focuses `#global-search`; Board
  and Backlog both render exactly two quick-filter chips; clicking "No Epic" toggles its `.active` class
  and toggling it back off restores the original visible card count; ArrowRight on a focused board card
  moves focus to another card; the admin Audit log screen renders a pagination bar with "Previous"
  disabled on page 1.

## 2026-08-03 — History activity tab on the ticket detail drawer (user-requested)

Requested directly by the user right after the Jira-layout batch landed: "a co pridat i zalozky history
activity transitions ???" ("and what about also adding History/Activity/Transitions tabs?").
`ticket_history` (`id`, `ticket_id`, `actor_user_id` nullable, `field_name`, `old_value`, `new_value`,
`created_at`) already existed and was already written to by `changeTicketStatus`, `editTicket`, and
`moveTicket`, but had no read-side API of its own until this batch -- purely write-only internal
bookkeeping.

### What changed

- **Backend.** New `IDatabase::listTicketHistory(ticketKey)` on both `SqliteDatabase` and
  `PostgresDatabase`, mirroring the existing `listComments`/`listWorklogs` per-ticket-list pattern (same
  signature shape, a `TicketHistorySelect` SQL constant analogous to the existing `*Select` constants,
  newest-first ordering `ORDER BY h.created_at DESC, h.id DESC`). The one structural difference from
  `listComments`/`listWorklogs`: `ticket_history.actor_user_id` is nullable (`ON DELETE SET NULL`), unlike
  `comments.author_user_id`/`worklogs.author_user_id` which are `NOT NULL`, so the query uses `LEFT JOIN
  users u ON u.id = h.actor_user_id` (not `JOIN`) and the read helper null-checks before resolving a
  `UserSummary` (`sqlite3_column_type(statement, 2) != SQLITE_NULL` for SQLite, `PQgetisnull(result, row,
  2) == 0` for PostgreSQL). `TicketService::listTicketHistory` is a plain read-access-gated passthrough
  (`requireReadAccess(actor); return database_->listTicketHistory(normalizeTicketKey(ticketKey));`). New
  `GET /api/v1/tickets/{key}/history` route in `src/web/Api.cpp` with a `ticketHistoryEntryJson`
  serializer, registered right before the existing comments GET route.
- **Frontend.** The drawer's `.activity-tabs` gained a third tab, `data-activity-tab="history"`, showing
  "History (N)". Its panel renders each entry as a Jira-style sentence via three new small helpers in
  `web/app.js`: `historyFieldLabel` (snake_case field name -> readable label, e.g. `story_points` ->
  "story points"), `historyValueLabel` (raw stored value -> display value -- resolves a status key through
  the existing `STATUSES` list, a priority/type key through two new small `PRIORITY_LABELS`/
  `TICKET_TYPE_LABELS` lookup maps, formats a due-date value through the existing `formatDate`, and
  truncates a long summary/description value to 80 chars), and `historyChangeText` (combines old/new labels
  into "set X to Y" / "cleared X (was Y)" / "changed X from Y to Z", matching Jira's own History tab
  phrasing). These maps are deliberately scoped to History rendering only -- not a refactor of the many
  pre-existing inline filter-dropdown option lists elsewhere in the file. No API or schema change beyond
  the new route -- this batch is additive read-exposure of an existing table only.

### Verification

- Full rebuild in all three build configurations (default, SQLite-only, PostgreSQL-only) with zero new
  warnings/errors; `ctest --output-on-failure` green in all three (new coverage in
  `tests/sqlite_integration_tests.cpp`: `listTicketHistory` returns the status-change row plus one row per
  field actually changed by a full edit; newest-first ordering; correct old/new values and resolved actor
  on the status entry; the assignee-field-change row from `editTicket` is present; an unknown ticket key
  returns an empty list, not an error).
- **Test-authoring bug caught by `ctest` and fixed, not a real backend bug.** The ordering assertion
  initially used `std::is_sorted` with a `>=` comparator on `createdAt` to check "newest first" -- not a
  valid strict weak ordering (fails irreflexivity: `comp(x, x)` is true for `>=`), which made `is_sorted`
  spuriously report "not sorted" whenever two adjacent history rows shared the exact same `created_at`
  (common, since several rows are written within one `editTicket` transaction at the same
  second-precision timestamp). Reproduced live via `curl` against a running server with the same status
  change + full edit sequence, inspected the raw JSON from `GET /api/v1/tickets/TH-1/history`, and
  confirmed the query's actual `ORDER BY ... DESC` was correct all along -- the bug was the test's
  comparator, not the SQL. Fixed to strict `a.createdAt > b.createdAt`, with a comment above the assertion
  explaining why `>=` is wrong here.
- Live-verified over real HTTP against a fresh throwaway PostgreSQL database and a fresh SQLite database: a
  status transition (`PATCH .../status`) and a full edit (`PATCH .../` with changed fields) each produce
  the expected `ticket_history` rows via `GET .../history`, with correctly resolved actor and old/new
  values. One test-scenario mistake caught and corrected during this pass (not a bug): an initial attempt
  PATCHed a ticket to a status it was already in, expecting a new history row, and got none -- checking the
  ticket's actual current status first confirmed it was a genuine same-status no-op (the target category
  wasn't Done, so the resolution-retroactive-confirm special case from the previous batch didn't apply
  either); retesting against a ticket with a different starting status produced the expected row.
- Full Playwright/Chromium browser pass (`verify_history_tab.js`) against a fresh SQLite database -- 8/8
  checks: three activity tabs present (Comments, Work log, History); History panel hidden by default;
  visible after clicking its tab; a real edit (summary + priority change) produces entries matching
  `/changed summary/` and `/changed priority/`; the priority entry shows the humanized label ("Low") not
  the raw key; no raw snake_case field names (`story_points`, `due_date`, `ticket_type`) leak into the
  rendered text; a status transition on a separate ticket shows readable status names ("Confirmed" ->
  "In Progress"), not raw status keys. README's `docs/screenshots/05-ticket-detail.png` regenerated,
  scrolled to the Activity section with the History tab active showing two realistic entries (a priority
  change and a summary change).

## 2026-08-03 — Ticket detail layout restyled to look more like Jira (user-requested)

Requested directly by the user: "prosim at je layout detailu ticketu vice podobny jire" ("please make the
ticket detail layout more similar to Jira"). A pure UI/layout restructure of the ticket drawer's template
in `web/app.js` and supporting CSS in `web/styles.css` -- no API or schema changes, and every existing
element `id`/`data-*` attribute kept exactly as it was, so no existing event-handler wiring needed to
change, only be relocated within the new markup.

### What changed

- **Status pill.** `#drawer-status` moved from a plain `<select class="status-select">` inside a
  `meta-row` in the sidebar to `<select class="status-pill status-pill--{category}">` directly under the
  title, in a new `.ticket-toolbar` row. `.status-pill` restyles the native select as a bold, rounded,
  colored pill (custom CSS-only dropdown-arrow via a background-image trick, since `appearance: none`
  removes the native one) using the exact same `todo`/`in_progress`/`done` category color variables
  `.status-chip` already used elsewhere in the app. The resolution picker/confirm-cancel flow
  (`#drawer-resolution-row`, now styled `.resolution-inline`) sits directly beside the pill instead of a
  separate labeled row further down.
- **Sidebar restructured into two panel cards.** The flat `.meta-list` (renamed `.drawer-sidebar`) is now
  two bordered `.sidebar-panel` cards: "Details" (Assignee, Reporter, Priority, Labels, Component, Story
  points, Due date, Parent, Move to project -- same conditional visibility during editing as before,
  unchanged) and a smaller "Dates" panel (Created, Updated, using new compact `.meta-row-compact` rows
  instead of the label-above-value `.meta-row` style, since Jira's own created/updated area is inline
  small text rather than a full field row).
- **Comments/Work log as Activity tabs.** New `.activity-tabs`/`.activity-panel` structure: two tab
  buttons (`data-activity-tab="comments"`/`"worklog"`, showing live counts) toggle which panel is visible
  via the `hidden` attribute. A new module-level `activeActivityTab` variable (declared outside
  `openTicket`, unlike the pre-existing `attachmentSort` which is scoped inside it and so resets on every
  full reopen) tracks the active tab so it survives a full drawer re-fetch -- logging time or posting a
  comment triggers `openTicket()` again internally, and without this the newly-added entry would land back
  on whichever tab was default (Comments) instead of the one the user was actually looking at. Each
  panel's add-form (`#comment-form`/`#worklog-form`) now renders above its list instead of below it,
  matching Jira's comment-box-at-top convention; `.comment-form`'s spacing rule changed from `margin-top`
  to `margin-bottom` to match, and `.worklog-form` gained a `margin-bottom` for the same reason. "Links"
  was relabeled "Linked issues" to match Jira's own terminology (no functional change).

### Two bugs found and fixed during this batch's own browser verification

1. **Pre-existing backend bug (not introduced by this batch).** `IDatabase::changeTicketStatus` (both
   `SqliteDatabase` and `PostgresDatabase`) had an unconditional same-status short-circuit: `if (oldStatus
   == statusKey) { COMMIT; return true; }`, executed *before* any resolution handling. This silently
   dropped a supplied resolution whenever the requested status matched the ticket's current status --
   including the one legitimate case this reachable through the UI: a ticket that is Done-category but has
   no resolution recorded (unreachable through the normal create/status-change API, which always requires
   a resolution for a genuine transition into Done, but possible with historical/imported/manually-seeded
   data), where a user opens the resolution-confirm control to set one retroactively without the status
   itself needing to change. Caught via `curl` reproduction after a Playwright test's final assertion
   (confirming a resolution on TH-1, which turned out to already be Done with a null resolution in the
   fresh seed data) passed a *weaker* check than intended -- the request returned `200 OK` but the response
   body showed `"resolution":null,"version":1` unchanged. Manually replaying the exact PATCH via `curl`
   confirmed the no-op. This flow existed identically in the pre-redesign layout (the old
   `#drawer-resolution-row` had the exact same conditional select-or-label markup, just positioned in the
   sidebar), so it's not a regression from this batch -- but relocating the resolution-confirm control to a
   much more prominent position makes it more likely to be encountered, so it was fixed here. Fix: the
   same-status guard now also checks whether the ticket is Done-category, has no resolution yet, and a
   valid one is being supplied (`settingMissingResolution`); only then does a same-status call proceed to
   the normal update path instead of short-circuiting. Every other same-status call (including one that
   redundantly re-supplies a resolution that's already set) remains a pure no-op, matching D68-D70's "any
   other transition leaves resolution alone." Applied identically to both adapters (SQLite additionally
   selects `i.resolution` in the existing lookup query and checks `sqlite3_column_type(...) != SQLITE_NULL`;
   PostgreSQL uses `PQgetisnull`).
2. **CSS regression introduced by this batch.** `.resolution-inline { display: flex; ... }` has the exact
   same selector specificity (one class) as the browser's default user-agent rule `[hidden] { display: none
   }` (one attribute selector), and since author stylesheets are applied after the UA stylesheet in the
   cascade, `.resolution-inline`'s `display: flex` won regardless of the `hidden` attribute being present
   -- so the resolution picker rendered even for non-Done-category tickets (caught by screenshotting an
   "In Progress" ticket and noticing the "Fixed" dropdown + Cancel/Confirm buttons sitting right next to
   the blue pill, which should never appear outside a Done-category ticket). Fixed with an explicit
   `.resolution-inline[hidden] { display: none; }` override -- the same class of fix would apply to any
   future element that combines a `hidden`-attribute-toggled visibility with a non-`none` `display` rule on
   the same selector; `.activity-panel` deliberately has no such CSS rule of its own, relying on the
   default `[hidden]` behavior without this pitfall.

### Verification

- Full rebuild in all three build configurations (default, SQLite-only, PostgreSQL-only) with zero new
  warnings/errors; `ctest --output-on-failure`: 8/8 green in the default and SQLite-only configurations
  (4/4 in PostgreSQL-only, unchanged), including new coverage in `tests/sqlite_integration_tests.cpp` for
  the resolution no-op-guard fix: a ticket is force-set to Done with no resolution via raw SQL (the only
  way to reach that state, since the normal API can't produce it); a same-status call with a resolution
  now persists it and increments the optimistic-lock version; a further same-status call once a resolution
  already exists remains a true no-op (resolution unchanged, version unchanged).
- Live-verified the resolution fix over real HTTP against a fresh throwaway PostgreSQL database and a
  fresh SQLite database: `PATCH .../status` with the ticket's current status and a resolution now returns
  the updated resolution and an incremented version (previously returned the stale, unchanged ticket); a
  second same-status call with a different resolution correctly stays a no-op (resolution and version both
  unchanged from the first confirm).
- Full Playwright/Chromium browser pass against fresh SQLite databases -- 20/20 checks across two runs (the
  first run's one "failure" was a Playwright timeout waiting for `#drawer-resolution`, which turned out to
  be *correct* behavior: an earlier `curl` reproduction step against that same live database had already
  set the resolution, so the drawer correctly showed the read-only label instead of the picker; a clean
  database re-run confirmed 20/20): status pill present with the right category class for Done/In
  Progress/Confirmed tickets; toolbar and both sidebar panels present with the right heading; both activity
  tabs present with live counts, Comments active by default, Work log hidden by default and vice versa
  after clicking; logging a Markdown worklog entry keeps the Work log tab active afterward and the new
  entry renders `<strong>`/`<li>` HTML, not literal Markdown syntax; posting a comment keeps the Comments
  tab active and the new comment appears; Watch/Edit still work and the toolbar (status pill) stays visible
  while editing; the resolution-confirm flow (select a resolution, click Confirm) correctly updates the
  status pill's category class. Screenshots captured for all three status-category pill colors (Done/
  green, In Progress/blue, Confirmed/gray) and a dark-mode pass, the latter two confirming the
  `[hidden]` CSS fix (In Progress and Confirmed tickets show no resolution picker) and that the new pill/
  panel styling reads correctly in dark mode. README's `docs/screenshots/05-ticket-detail.png` regenerated
  against the new layout, scrolled to show the Activity tabs with a rendered Markdown worklog entry.

## 2026-08-03 — Dedicated Backlog screen, Markdown worklogs, Created/Updated columns (user-requested)

Requested directly by the user: "uprav board backlog muze byt obrovsky a nebude v vlastnim sloupci
backlog ukoly by mely mit svoji specialni obrazovku" ("fix the board -- backlog can be huge and won't be
in its own column, backlog tickets should have their own dedicated screen"), then mid-batch "kazdy ticket
bude mit komentarea worklogy. worklogy budou take markdown supported a ne jednoradkove nasilne jako nyni.
ticket musi mit i created a updated" ("every ticket will have comments and worklogs; worklogs will also be
Markdown-supported and not forced single-line as now; a ticket must also have created and updated").

### What changed

- **Board columns amend D32.** D32 ("one board column equals one workflow status") originally put every
  fixed workflow status, including Backlog, on the board. Removed: the board is now 4 columns (Confirmed,
  In Progress, In Review, Done). `web/app.js`'s `renderBoard` now maps over a new `BOARD_STATUSES = STATUSES
  .filter(status => status.key !== 'backlog')` constant instead of the full `STATUSES` array, and a new
  `fetchBoardTickets()` replaces the old unfiltered `fetchTickets()` call with one status-filtered
  `GET /api/v1/tickets?project=...&status=...` request per board column (run in parallel via
  `Promise.all`) -- so the board's fixed 200-row-per-request budget is spent entirely on the four statuses
  it actually renders, instead of possibly being silently consumed by backlog rows that would never have
  appeared on the board anyway once a project's backlog grew past ~200 tickets (a real correctness gap
  the old single-fetch approach had, not just a display preference). A new "☰ Backlog" button in the
  board's page-actions area links to the new screen; the header copy now says "Backlog tickets live on
  their own screen."
- **New dedicated Backlog screen** (`renderBacklog` in `web/app.js`, new `data-view="backlog"` nav item
  between Board and Tickets in `web/index.html`). This is the first list view in this app to use real
  server-side pagination (`page`/`pageSize`, D126's existing contract, `BacklogPageSize = 50`) rather than
  the fixed 200-row cap every other list still relies on -- justified because a project's backlog is
  explicitly unbounded by design (everything not yet actively worked ends up there), unlike every other
  list. A "▦ Board" button links back. Filter bar: type, priority, assignee, label, component, and search
  (reusing the same `ticketFilterParams()`-driven server-side filtering the Tickets view already uses),
  always scoped to exactly one project (`state.selectedProject`, defaulting to the first project, with its
  own project-select dropdown) since rank order and the reorder arrows are only meaningful within one
  project. `state.backlogPage` resets to 1 on any filter/project change but is left alone across an
  internal re-render (e.g. after a reorder), so the user's position in a large backlog survives their own
  actions. Pagination controls show `{totalItems} backlog tickets — page {page} of {totalPages}` with
  Previous/Next buttons, disabled at the first/last page respectively.
- **New `sort=rank` query parameter** on `GET /api/v1/tickets` (`ticketFilterFromQuery` in `src/web/
  Api.cpp`; new `Domain::TicketFilter::sortByRank` field, default `false`). Both database adapters'
  `listTickets(filter)` and `listTickets(filter, limit, offset)` overloads now build their `ORDER BY`
  clause conditionally: `rank_order, ticket_number` when `sortByRank` is set, the pre-existing `updated_at
  DESC, ticket_key DESC` otherwise -- a small, backward-compatible addition; every existing caller that
  never sends `sort=rank` gets exactly the same order it always did. The Backlog screen always sends it, so
  "page 1" is always the top of the backlog by manual priority rank, not an arbitrary recency-based cut a
  plain offset over the default order would otherwise produce. The existing manual-reorder up/down arrows
  (D31, `ticketRows`'s `orderable` option, reusing the exact same `reorderTicket` API call and anchor logic
  the Tickets view's own arrows already use) work unmodified on this screen -- always enabled here (unlike
  the Tickets view, where they're conditional on a single project being selected) since the Backlog screen
  is always single-project-scoped by construction. Reordering only ever works within the currently
  displayed page (the up/down arrows are disabled for the first/last row of each page respectively), a
  known, expected limitation of combining pagination with manual reordering, not attempted to be solved
  here.
- **Worklogs are Markdown-supported, not forced single-line.** The "what did you work on" field
  (`#worklog-form`) was a plain single-line `<input>`, rendered on display with `escapeHtml` into an inline
  `<span>`. The backend already allowed up to 10,000 characters with no single-line restriction
  (`Domain::validateAddWorklog`/`appendWorklogContentErrors`, and the `worklogs.comment` column is `TEXT`)
  -- this was purely a frontend gap. Changed the field to a `<textarea>` and attached the exact same
  Markdown toolbar, live preview, drag/drop+paste attachment support, and @mention autocomplete already
  used for comments and the ticket description (`attachMarkdownToolbar`/`attachMentionAutocomplete`, the
  same calls the comment form already makes, just targeting `#worklog-form textarea[name=comment]`
  instead). On display, `worklog.comment` now renders through `renderMarkdown` into a `.markdown-body
  worklog-comment` block instead of an escaped inline span.
- **Created/Updated columns on every ticket list table.** The ticket detail drawer already showed both
  (`ticket.createdAt` via `formatDate`, `ticket.updatedAt` via `relativeDate` with the raw timestamp in a
  `title` tooltip) but neither ticket *list* did. `ticketRows` (shared by the Tickets view and the new
  Backlog screen) gained a new `showTimestamps` option, default `true`, adding both columns; the column
  count used for the empty-state `colspan` and both call sites' `<thead>` markup were updated to match.
  The Dashboard's compact "Assigned to me"/"Tickets I'm watching"/"Recently active tickets" widgets
  (`tablePanel`) explicitly pass `{ showTimestamps: false }` to keep their existing terser 6-column layout,
  matching their own "focused overview" framing -- no schema or API change, since `createdAt`/`updatedAt`
  were already present on every ticket JSON response.

### Verification

- Full rebuild in all three build configurations (default, SQLite-only, PostgreSQL-only) with zero new
  warnings/errors; `ctest --output-on-failure`: 8/8 green in the default and SQLite-only configurations
  (4/4 in PostgreSQL-only, unchanged from every prior batch), including new coverage in
  `tests/sqlite_integration_tests.cpp`: `TicketFilter::sortByRank` orders both the unpaginated and
  paginated `listTickets` overloads by `(rank_order, ticket_number)` (verified with `std::is_sorted`, and
  that the ticket most recently moved to the end of rank order via `reorderTicket` sorts last), and that
  omitting `sortByRank` does *not* happen to already be in rank order (i.e. genuinely tests the default
  path is different, not just that the flag exists).
- Live-verified against a fresh throwaway PostgreSQL database over real HTTP: `GET /api/v1/tickets?
  project=TH&status=selected` (one of the board's per-column fetches) returns only the ticket in that
  status; `GET /api/v1/tickets?project=TH&status=backlog&sort=rank&page=1&pageSize=1` returns the
  lowest-`rank_order` backlog ticket first with the correct pagination envelope
  (`totalItems`/`totalPages`); `POST .../worklogs` with a multi-line, Markdown-syntax comment
  (`"Fixed the **bug**\n\n- step one\n- step two"`) round-trips byte-for-byte through the database.
- Full Playwright/Chromium browser pass against a fresh SQLite database seeded with 62 backlog tickets (60
  created via the API in a loop specifically to exercise real pagination) -- 19/19 checks: the board shows
  exactly 4 columns with no "Backlog" among them; the Board's "☰ Backlog" button navigates to the Backlog
  screen and the nav item becomes active; the Backlog screen's page-info text and row counts are correct
  on both page 1 (50 rows) and page 2 (12 rows); the Previous button is disabled on page 1 and the Next
  button is disabled on the last page (and vice versa); the Backlog table has Created/Updated columns;
  clicking a "move down" reorder arrow changes the visible row order; the Backlog screen's "▦ Board" button
  navigates back; the Tickets view also has Created/Updated columns; the Dashboard's compact widgets do
  *not* gain Created/Updated columns; the worklog field is a `<textarea>` with a Markdown toolbar attached;
  and submitting a worklog with `**bold**` and a bullet list renders `<strong>bold</strong>` and real
  `<li>` elements rather than literal Markdown syntax. Screenshots regenerated for `README.md`: the Board
  screenshot (no Backlog column), a new Backlog screenshot, the Tickets screenshot (Created/Updated
  columns), and the ticket detail screenshot (now showing a rendered Markdown worklog entry with bold text
  and a bullet list).

## 2026-08-03 — Five V1-decided gaps found by a full decision-register audit (D62/D66/D129/D45/D91) (user-requested)

Requested directly by the user: first "analyzuj a najdi pripadne mezery mezi v1 a co je skutecne
implementovano" ("analyze and find any gaps between V1 and what is actually implemented"), then
"implementuj prosim vsechny tyto mezery" ("please implement all these gaps"). Every one of the 142
decisions in `docs/REDUCED_SCOPE_DECISIONS.md` was re-read and, where classified `KEEP_FOR_V1` or
`ALREADY_IMPLEMENTED_AND_KEEP`, checked against the real codebase. Five real gaps were found (D101's
attachment sortable list, initially suspected, turned out to be correctly implemented on closer reading --
a false alarm, not a sixth gap). All five were implemented, tested, and verified in this batch.

### What changed

- **D62 (Markdown checklist syntax)**: `renderMarkdown`'s unordered-list branch (`web/app.js`) now matches
  each list item against `/^\[([ xX])\]\s+(.*)$/` and, on a match, emits `<li class="checklist-item"><input
  type="checkbox" disabled ${checked}> ...</li>` instead of literal `[ ]`/`[x]` text. Two new CSS rules
  (`web/styles.css`) remove the default list bullet and align the checkbox inline. Pure client-side
  rendering change, no backend/schema involvement.
- **D66 ("No Epic" ticket filter)**: a new `#ticket-epic-filter` select on the Tickets view filter bar
  (`Any hierarchy` / `No Epic`), backed by a new client-side-only `state.filterEpic` -- matching D10's
  "ad-hoc, in-UI-only filters" convention, no new server-side query parameter. `renderTicketsView` filters
  the already-fetched `state.tickets` to `ticketTypeHierarchyLevel(ticket.type.key) === 0 &&
  !ticket.parentTicketKey` when active (Story/Task/Bug tickets with no parent -- excludes both Epics, which
  have no "Epic" of their own by definition, and Sub-tasks, whose parent is never an Epic).
- **D129 (stale-write conflict dialog)**: the `api()` helper now attaches `error.status = response.status`
  to every thrown error, so call sites can branch on the exact HTTP status without re-parsing the response.
  A new `showConflictDialog(ticketKey)` (same dynamically-created-modal pattern as
  `promptBoardResolution`/`openComponentsModal`) is now invoked from both `applyStatusChange`'s and the
  ticket edit-save handler's `catch` blocks when `error.status === 409` -- explaining that someone else
  changed the ticket and offering "Reload latest version" (`openTicket(ticketKey, true)`, re-opening the
  drawer in edit mode with fresh server data) instead of the previous generic error toast. `openTicket`
  gained an `editing` parameter to support reopening directly into edit mode.
- **D45 (per-user timezone/clock-format preferences)**: `users.time_zone`/`clock_format` already existed in
  the schema but had no self-service write path. New `PATCH /api/v1/account/preferences`
  (`src/web/Api.cpp`) -> `TicketService::updatePreferences` -> `IDatabase::updateUserPreferences` (new pure
  virtual, implemented in both adapters as a single-row `UPDATE`), validated by the new
  `Domain::validateUpdatePreferences`/`isValidClockFormat` (`src/domain/Validation.h/.cpp`: non-empty
  timezone string up to 80 characters, `clockFormat` exactly `"12h"` or `"24h"`). `Domain::Principal`
  (`src/domain/Models.h`) gained `timeZone`/`clockFormat` fields, default-initialized to `"UTC"`/`"24h"` so
  every pre-existing 4-argument brace-init call site across tests and `AuthService::toPrincipal` keeps
  compiling unmodified (confirmed via `grep -rn "Domain::Principal{" src/` finding exactly one
  non-test construction site). `principalJson` now includes both fields. New "Preferences" panel on the
  Account view (`web/app.js`): a timezone `<input>` with an `Intl.supportedValuesOf('timeZone')` datalist
  (try/catch fallback for older browsers), a clock-format `<select>`, and a "Detect from browser" button
  (`Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone`). The "has this user manually set a preference"
  signal is tracked client-side in `localStorage` (`th-preferences-manual`), not a server column --
  deliberately, so a fresh login auto-detects at most once per browser and never overwrites a value the
  user set themselves (including a deliberate `UTC`, which a nullable-sentinel server column could not
  distinguish from "never touched"), and so the same account correctly carries different preferences on
  different devices/timezones. `formatDate` now sniffs a date-only value (`/^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$/` -- ticket
  due dates, worklog dates) via a new `isDateOnly` helper and renders it in UTC with no time-of-day and no
  shift, per D45's own decision text ("date-only stays date-only"); a full timestamp renders in the
  viewer's stored timezone and 12h/24h format. This is format-sniffed from the value itself, not
  per-call-site, so all ~15 existing `formatDate` call sites needed no changes.
- **D91 (changing an active project's key)**: new `PATCH /api/v1/projects/{key}/key` (project-Admin-or-
  above, same level as archiving/deleting a project) -> `TicketService::changeProjectKey` (validates
  `newKey` via `Domain::isValidProjectKey` and rejects a no-op rename) -> `IDatabase::changeProjectKey` (new
  pure virtual, implemented in both adapters as one transaction): the vacated key becomes a permanent
  `project_key_aliases` row (this table existed in the schema for D90's "reserved while in the recycle bin"
  invariant but had never been written to by an active-project rename), the project's `project_key` column
  is updated, and every ticket that ever belonged to the project -- including soft-deleted ones, since a key
  must stay permanently resolvable regardless of the ticket's own lifecycle state -- is renamed to the new
  prefix with the same numeric suffix, its own vacated key becoming a `ticket_key_aliases` row exactly like
  `moveTicket` (D38) already does for a single ticket. Rejects (`std::invalid_argument`, mapped to HTTP 400)
  a `newKey` already live on another active project or already reserved by an existing
  `project_key_aliases` entry. Returns `nullopt` (mapped to HTTP 404) if the old key does not resolve to a
  live project. New "Rename key" button on each project card opens a new dynamically-created modal
  (`openRenameProjectKeyModal`, same pattern as the other three modals in this file) warning that every
  ticket key in the project will change, with a text input for the new key.

Two real bugs were found and fixed during this batch's own browser verification, surfaced by D91 and D129
respectively but not narrowly scoped to either decision's own text:

1. The web client's `state.selectedProject` was not updated when the *currently selected* project was the
   one renamed -- since `state.selectedProject ||= ...` only assigns when currently falsy, it kept pointing
   at the now-nonexistent old key forever, so the Tickets/Board views silently went empty (filtering
   `?project=<old key>` server-side, which correctly finds nothing) until the user manually reselected a
   project from the dropdown. Fixed in `openRenameProjectKeyModal`'s success handler: if
   `state.selectedProject === projectKey` (the key just renamed), follow it to `newKey` before refreshing.
2. `.modal-backdrop` shared a single CSS rule (and `z-index: 80`) with `.drawer-backdrop`, both lower than
   `.ticket-drawer`'s `z-index: 90`. Any modal opened while the ticket drawer is showing therefore rendered
   *behind* the drawer and was completely unclickable -- most consequentially D129's own conflict dialog,
   which is triggered by a failed save from inside the drawer's edit form, exactly the scenario where it's
   needed most. First caught as a Playwright timeout ("`<div class="empty-state">No links yet.</div>` ...
   intercepts pointer events") when clicking the dialog's "Reload latest version" button; confirmed by
   inspecting the two rules' `z-index` values. Fixed by splitting the shared rule: `.drawer-backdrop` keeps
   `z-index: 80` (correctly below the ticket drawer it belongs to), `.modal-backdrop` now has its own
   `z-index: 100` (above everything, since a modal dialog must always be the topmost layer regardless of
   what else happens to be open behind it).

### Verification

- Full rebuild in all three build configurations (default, `-DTICKETHUB_WITH_POSTGRES=OFF` SQLite-only,
  `-DTICKETHUB_WITH_SQLITE=OFF` PostgreSQL-only) with zero new warnings/errors; `ctest --output-on-failure`:
  8/8 green in the default and SQLite-only configurations (4/4 in PostgreSQL-only, which only ever runs the
  tests that don't require a live database connection -- unchanged from every prior batch), including new
  coverage:
  - `tests/domain_validation_tests.cpp`: valid/invalid `UpdatePreferencesRequest` (empty timezone, an
    out-of-range `clockFormat` like `"30h"`), `isValidClockFormat` accepting exactly `"12h"`/`"24h"`.
  - `tests/sqlite_integration_tests.cpp`: `updateUserPreferences` + `findUserById` round-trip (default
    `UTC`/`24h` confirmed on a freshly-seeded user, then both fields updated and read back); `changeProjectKey`
    renaming `WEB` -> `SITE` -- the returned project reflects the new key, the old key is recorded in
    `project_key_aliases`, the ticket that was earlier moved into `WEB` (via the pre-existing `moveTicket`
    test in the same file) now resolves as `SITE-3`, its old key `WEB-3` still resolves via
    `ticket_key_aliases`, renaming to a key already live on another project is rejected, renaming to a key
    reserved by an existing alias is rejected, and renaming an unknown project key returns `nullopt`.
  - `tests/authorization_integration_tests.cpp`: `changeProjectKey` against a dedicated throwaway `RK`
    project (not the shared `QA` project used by the surrounding lifecycle tests, since a vacated key is
    permanently reserved per D90 and reusing `QA` would have broken every assertion below it in the file) --
    a non-member is rejected, a project admin who is not a global admin can rename their own project, a
    no-op self-rename is rejected, a live-key collision is rejected, an alias-reserved-key collision is
    rejected, and an unknown project key returns `nullopt` rather than throwing.
- Live-verified against a fresh throwaway PostgreSQL role/database (`migrate` + `seed-demo`, then a real
  server process against it): `PATCH /api/v1/account/preferences` round-trips through `GET /api/v1/auth/me`;
  `PATCH /api/v1/projects/TH/key` renamed it to `GAPT`, `GET /api/v1/tickets/GAPT-1` resolved the renamed
  ticket, `GET /api/v1/tickets/TH-1` (the old key) still resolved to the same ticket via
  `ticket_key_aliases`, `SELECT alias_key FROM project_key_aliases`/`ticket_key_aliases` via `psql` confirmed
  the expected rows, renaming `WEB` to the live key `GAPT` was rejected, and renaming `WEB` to the
  alias-reserved key `TH` was rejected; a stale `PATCH /api/v1/tickets/GAPT-1` with a wrong
  `expectedVersion` returned `409` as expected by the new conflict dialog.
- The identical live-verify pass repeated against a fresh throwaway SQLite database with the same results
  (`TH` -> `LITE`, `LITE-1`/`TH-1` both resolving, both collision cases rejected, `409` on a stale edit).
- Full Playwright/Chromium browser pass against a fresh SQLite database (13/13 checks, after the two fixes
  above): a checklist Markdown edit renders real, disabled checkboxes with the checked item actually
  checked; the No Epic filter control is present and re-renders without error; the Preferences panel is
  present, a saved timezone/clock-format survives a view-navigate-away-and-back reload, the
  detect-from-browser button fills a value, and a ticket due date set to `2026-12-31` still renders as
  "Dec 31, 2026" (not shifted) after switching to a non-UTC timezone; the Rename key button is present and a
  rename is reflected in the Projects view; and -- across two tabs sharing one authenticated browser
  context -- editing and saving the same ticket in tab 2 first, then attempting a stale save in tab 1,
  produces the conflict dialog, and its "Reload latest version" button (only clickable at all after the
  z-index fix above) correctly repopulates the edit form with tab 2's saved summary.

## 2026-08-03 — Project components (D19, `KEEP_FOR_V1`) (user-requested)

Requested directly by the user ("implementuj prosim komponenty" -- "please implement components") after
asking whether tickets support priority/components/labels/created/updated, and being told components were
decided `KEEP_FOR_V1` in `docs/REDUCED_SCOPE_DECISIONS.md` (D19: "Simple project components: name,
description, lead, default assignee; at most one per issue") but were never actually implemented -- a real
gap between the decision register and the built schema, with zero trace of `component`/`project_components`
anywhere in migrations, `src/`, or `web/`.

### What changed

- New migration `migrations/{sqlite,postgresql}/017_project_components.sql`: `project_components` (`id`,
  `project_id`, `name`, `description`, `lead_user_id` nullable, `default_assignee_user_id` nullable,
  `created_at`, `updated_at`, `UNIQUE(project_id, name)`) and `tickets.component_id` (nullable, `ON DELETE
  SET NULL`). No recycle bin/soft-delete columns -- D19 doesn't call for one, unlike tickets/projects/
  comments, which have explicit D22/D88-D89/D82 decisions; kept as "a small table plus one optional ticket
  field," exactly the decision text's own framing, no scope reduction needed since D19 was already "the
  cheapest reasonable form."
- `Domain::ComponentSummary` (compact id+name, embedded in `Ticket`, mirrors how `TicketType`/`Priority`
  are embedded) and `Domain::ProjectComponent` (the full row) added to `src/domain/Models.h`, plus
  `CreateComponentRequest`/`EditComponentRequest` (full-replacement PUT-style, matching every other edit
  request in this codebase) and `Domain::validateCreateComponent`/`validateEditComponent`.
  `CreateTicketRequest`/`EditTicketRequest` gained `componentName` (resolved by name against the ticket's
  own project's components -- a human-readable identifier, like `assigneeEmail`/`priorityKey`/`label`, not
  a raw component id); `TicketFilter` gained a matching `componentName` filter.
- `IDatabase::listComponents`/`createComponent`/`findComponentById`/`editComponent`/`deleteComponent`,
  implemented in both adapters. `createTicket`/`editTicket`/`listTickets`(both overloads)/`countTickets`
  updated to resolve/filter/return the component; `TicketSelect` gained a `LEFT JOIN project_components`
  and two trailing columns (`comp.id`, `comp.name`) in both adapters, appended at the end of the existing
  column list rather than inserted in the middle, so no other column's positional index needed
  renumbering.
- `TicketService::listComponents`/`createComponent`/`editComponent`/`deleteComponent`: read access mirrors
  projects/tickets (any authenticated user, or anonymous if the installation toggle is on);
  create/edit/delete require project-Admin-or-above, the same level as archiving/deleting a project itself
  -- no separate "component admin" role. `editComponent`/`deleteComponent` are scoped to `(projectKey,
  componentId)` together, not `componentId` alone -- the same IDOR-safe pattern the Phase 8 threat-model
  pass established for worklogs/comments/attachments -- so a component id belonging to a different project
  is treated as not found, never silently acted on through the wrong project's URL.
  `TicketService::cloneTicket` (D60) now also copies the component into the clone, per the original
  decision text's own "summary/description/type/priority/labels/component" clone-field list (D60's text
  already named "component" -- this was simply unreachable before components existed).
- New REST routes: `GET`/`POST /api/v1/projects/{key}/components`, `PATCH`/`DELETE
  /api/v1/projects/{key}/components/{id}`. `ticketJson` gained a `component: {id, name} | null` field;
  `POST`/`PATCH /api/v1/tickets` accept `componentName`; `GET /api/v1/tickets` accepts a `component` query
  parameter.
- `web/`: a new "Components" button on each project card (Projects view) opens a dynamically-created
  dialog (same pattern as the board's drag-and-drop resolution prompt) to list/add/delete a project's
  components. The ticket create modal and the ticket drawer's edit form both gained a Component picker,
  refetched whenever the selected project changes (same request-id-guarded async pattern as the existing
  Epic/parent pickers, to discard a stale response superseded by a newer one); the drawer's read-only view
  and the tickets-table filter bar both gained a Component row/filter.

### Verification

- Full rebuild in all three build configurations (default, SQLite-only, PostgreSQL-only) with zero new
  warnings; `ctest --output-on-failure`: 8/8 green, including new coverage --
  `domain_validation_tests` (valid/invalid `CreateComponentRequest`/`EditComponentRequest`),
  `sqlite_integration_tests` (create/list/duplicate-name-rejection/edit/delete, a ticket created with
  `componentName` round-trips it, the `componentName` ticket filter matches/excludes correctly and agrees
  with `countTickets`, and deleting a component clears it from a ticket that referenced it via `ON DELETE
  SET NULL` -- verified with a scratch ticket that is cleaned up via soft-delete + permanent-delete so it
  doesn't disturb the exact-total dashboard/recycle-bin assertions later in the same test file, a real
  ordering bug this batch found and fixed on the first test run), and `authorization_integration_tests`
  (project-Admin-or-above enforced for create/edit/delete against both the TH and WEB seed projects; a
  dedicated IDOR regression confirming a WEB component cannot be edited or deleted through a TH project
  URL, even for a global administrator who passes the role check for every project).
- Fresh `migrate` + `seed-demo` against a throwaway live PostgreSQL database: confirmed
  `project_components` and `tickets.component_id` exist with the expected FK/unique constraints via
  `psql`; a live HTTP smoke test over the real API -- login, create a component, create a ticket
  referencing it by name, filter `GET /api/v1/tickets?component=...`, edit the component, delete it, and
  re-fetch the ticket to confirm its `component` field is now `null` (the `ON DELETE SET NULL` behavior
  exercised through the actual REST layer, not just the database adapter test).
- The same fresh-migrate-and-seed check against a throwaway SQLite database, confirmed via
  `sqlite_master`/`PRAGMA foreign_key_check` (zero violations).
- Browser-verified with Playwright/Chromium against the SQLite-backed server: opened the Components dialog
  from a project card, confirmed the initial empty state, added a component with a lead, confirmed it
  listed; created a ticket through the create modal with that component selected and confirmed it
  appeared in the tickets table; opened the ticket and confirmed the drawer's Component row showed it;
  filtered the tickets table by component name and confirmed only the matching ticket showed. A real
  layout bug was found and fixed along the way: the components list row (label text + Delete button)
  initially reused the `.meta-row` class, which is only ever styled for a label-then-value *stacked*
  layout (as used in the ticket drawer) -- visually cramped, though not a true DOM overlap (confirmed via
  bounding-box measurement before fixing). Replaced with an explicit flex row (label left, Delete button
  right), matching the rest of the app's list-row conventions; re-verified with a fresh screenshot.
  Also hit and worked around a pre-existing, unrelated timing behavior while writing the test: `showAppShell()` unhides the app shell before
  `loadBaseData()`/`renderDashboard()` finish their own async fetches, so a test that navigates away from
  Dashboard immediately after the app shell becomes visible can race a still-in-flight
  `renderDashboard()` call, which writes to `#content` unconditionally once its fetch resolves regardless
  of the current view -- not a bug introduced by this batch, and not fixed here (out of scope), but noted
  since it will bite the next Playwright script that navigates immediately after login without waiting for
  the dashboard's own content (e.g. `.stat-card`) to actually render first.

## 2026-08-03 — Full "issue" -> "ticket" terminology rename (user-requested)

Requested directly by the user: "issue nahrad prosim za ticket vsude v nazvech ui i db tabulkach"
("replace 'issue' with 'ticket' everywhere, in UI names and DB tables"). Given the scope's blast radius
(database schema, REST API contracts, ~2500 code occurrences across ~40 files, a breaking API change), the
user was asked one clarifying question -- whether this should also cover REST API paths
(`/api/v1/issues`) and internal C++/CSS naming, or stay narrower -- and chose the fully comprehensive
option ("Kompletně všude").

### What changed

- New migration `migrations/{sqlite,postgresql}/016_ticket_terminology.sql`: renames every `issue*`
  table (`issues` -> `tickets`, plus `issue_history`/`issue_key_aliases`/`issue_labels`/`issue_links`/
  `issue_statuses`/`issue_types`/`issue_votes`/`issue_watchers`), every `issue_id`/`issue_number`/
  `issue_key`/`issue_type_id`/`parent_issue_id`/`next_issue_number` column, and every index. Pure rename,
  no data or behavior change. SQLite auto-rewrites the `CHECK`/`FOREIGN KEY` definitions that reference a
  renamed table/column (empirically verified against a throwaway in-memory database before writing the
  migration); PostgreSQL's OID-based dependency tracking needs no equivalent handling. The PostgreSQL
  migration additionally renames every auto-generated constraint name (primary keys, unique constraints,
  foreign keys, checks) -- a table/column `RENAME` does not rename those on its own, and while no
  application code references a constraint name, this was done anyway for full consistency with the
  "everywhere" scope. `migrations/{sqlite,postgresql}/002_seed_demo.sql` (the mutable, non-checksummed
  seed script) updated to insert into the renamed tables/columns; its demo prose ("recent tickets",
  "Implement ticket creation dialog", ...) reads naturally since every occurrence was already about the
  domain entity, not the generic English word.
- Every C++ type, method, and identifier renamed: `Domain::Issue` -> `Domain::Ticket`,
  `TicketService::createIssue`/`editIssue`/`deleteIssue`/... -> `createTicket`/`editTicket`/
  `deleteTicket`/..., `IDatabase`'s issue-shaped methods, `Domain::WorkflowViolation` messages, and every
  `issue`-named local variable/parameter/comment across `src/` and `tests/`.
- Every REST route and JSON field renamed: `/api/v1/issues` -> `/api/v1/tickets` (and every nested route
  under it), `issueKey` -> `ticketKey`, `parentIssueKey` -> `parentTicketKey`, `issueTypeKey` ->
  `ticketTypeKey`, etc. This is a breaking API change -- any existing client/bookmark using the old paths
  or field names stops working; no compatibility shim was added, consistent with this being a pre-release
  V1 product with no external API consumers yet.
- `web/`: every CSS class (`.issue-card` -> `.ticket-card`, etc.), `data-issue-key` -> `data-ticket-key`,
  every function/variable name, and all user-facing text (nav items, headers, buttons, empty-state copy,
  placeholders) renamed. `GET /browse/{key}` and its route path are unchanged, since it already used a
  generic `{key}` term rather than "issue".
- The rename itself was mechanical: a case-preserving substring pass (`"Issue"` -> `"Ticket"`, then
  `"issue"` -> `"ticket"`) applied only to a fixed, pre-identified list of files known to reference the
  domain entity -- not blindly repo-wide. This produced exactly one systematic grammar artifact, "an
  issue" -> "an ticket" (since "ticket" doesn't take the "an" article "issue" did), found via a
  repo-wide grep afterward and fixed to "a ticket" across every C++ comment/error string, test
  description, doc, and the one occurrence in `web/app.js`'s user-visible text. A second grep confirmed no
  other English words containing "issue" as a substring exist in this codebase (no "tissue", "issuer",
  "reissue") that could have been corrupted, and no all-caps `ISSUE` tokens needed a third replacement
  rule.
- Documentation was split by nature, consistent with how this project has always treated its own written
  history: `docs/SCHEMA.md`, `docs/SCOPE.md`, and the non-narrative sections of `README.md` (feature list,
  architecture, API reference table) describe current state and were renamed in place, with a new
  `016_ticket_terminology.sql` entry added to `docs/SCHEMA.md`'s migration list. The dated historical batch
  narratives -- `README.md`'s "Server verification" section, `NEXT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and this file --
  describe what was literally true, and named, at the time, so they were left exactly as written; a new
  dated entry was added to each instead (this entry; the `NEXT.md`/`CHANGELOG.md`/`PLAN.md` counterparts
  are batch 6 of the post-V1 optional-follow-up list).

### Verification

- Full rebuild (`cmake --build`) with zero new warnings or errors beyond Crow's own pre-existing
  `-Wconversion` noise; `ctest --output-on-failure`: 8/8 green.
- Fresh `migrate` + `seed-demo` against a throwaway live PostgreSQL database (`tickethub_verify`, created
  and dropped for this check only), followed by a direct `pg_constraint`/`pg_indexes` query confirming
  zero remaining table, index, or constraint names containing "issue" anywhere in the schema, and a
  `SELECT` confirming the demo data seeded correctly under the new column names.
- The same fresh-migrate-and-seed check against a throwaway SQLite database, queried directly via
  `sqlite_master` and `PRAGMA foreign_key_check` (zero violations, zero "issue"-named tables/indexes).
- A live HTTP smoke test against the PostgreSQL-backed server: login via `POST /api/v1/auth/login`,
  `GET /api/v1/tickets` returning the seeded tickets with `ticketKey`/`parentTicketKey` fields, and
  `GET /browse/TH-1` returning the app shell.
- A full Playwright/Chromium browser pass against the SQLite-backed server: logged in, confirmed the
  rendered page body contains no "Issue"/"Issues" text anywhere, opened a ticket via its table row
  (`data-ticket-key`) and confirmed the URL updated to `/browse/TH-1` and the drawer opened, navigated
  directly to `/browse/TH-2` and confirmed the same, and created a brand-new ticket through the "+ Create"
  modal and confirmed it appeared in the tickets table -- full create/open/deep-link CRUD path exercised
  end-to-end after the rename, on both database backends.

## 2026-08-03 — Jira-style direct issue links (`/browse/{key}`) (user-requested)

Requested directly by the user after asking whether Ticket Hub supports Jira-style `/browse/ABC-123`
URLs -- it didn't (the app was a pure client-state SPA with no URL routing/deep-linking at all, confirmed
by grepping for `history.`/`pushState`/`location.` in `web/app.js` and finding nothing). This adds it.

### What changed

- New server route in `src/web/HttpServer.cpp`: `GET /browse/<string>` serves the exact same `index.html`
  shell as `/` (same security headers, same CSP), so a bookmarked/shared `/browse/TH-123` link works on a
  fresh page load or reload, not just client-side navigation. The `<string>` path segment is never
  inspected server-side -- authorization and the actual key lookup happen through the existing
  `GET /api/v1/issues/{key}` route, exactly as any other issue open already does.
- `web/app.js` gained three small pieces of URL-sync plumbing around the existing `openIssue`/
  `closeDrawer` functions (no new UI, no new API calls):
  - `openIssue(issueKey)` now calls `history.pushState(..., /browse/{key})`, but *only* when the current
    URL doesn't already match that key. This one guard does triple duty: a normal click/keyboard-open
    pushes a fresh entry (the common case); every other existing call site that re-invokes
    `openIssue(issue.key)` to refresh the drawer's content after a mutation (edit, comment, watch/vote,
    worklog, clone, move, ...) does *not* push a duplicate entry, since the URL is already correct --
    without this guard, every mutation on an open issue would have spammed a new, identical browser-
    history entry; and the `popstate` handler below doesn't need a separate "don't push" flag, since by
    the time it runs the browser has already updated the URL to match.
  - `closeDrawer()` now pushes back to `/`, but only if the URL is currently on a `/browse/...` path (so
    it's a no-op when the drawer was never opened from one).
  - A new `popstate` listener reacts to the browser's Back/Forward buttons: opens the issue named in the
    now-current URL, or closes the drawer if the URL no longer names one.
  - `openIssueFromUrlIfAny()`, called once after the initial page-load bootstrap and once after a
    successful login, opens whatever issue the URL names -- covering both "already has a session, loads
    `/browse/TH-5` directly" and "session expired/never existed, shown the login screen while sitting on
    `/browse/TH-5`, then logs in and lands on it anyway" (the login flow needed no extra code for the
    second case: the URL never changes while the login screen is up, so the same lookup on the post-login
    path picks it up naturally).
- No backend/schema changes beyond the one new static route; no new API endpoints.

### Verification

Browser-verified with Playwright/Chromium, covering every combination:
- Direct navigation to `/browse/TH-1` while logged out: shows the login screen (server-side auth gating
  is unaffected, same as `/`); after logging in, the drawer opens straight to TH-1 with no extra click.
- Clicking a different issue (TH-2) updates the URL to `/browse/TH-2`.
- A full page reload while on `/browse/TH-2` (session cookie already present) opens directly to TH-2 with
  no login screen flash.
- Browser Back from `/browse/TH-3` correctly hides the drawer and returns to `/`; Forward correctly
  reopens TH-3.
- Two consecutive mutations on the open issue (watch/unwatch) leave `history.length` unchanged --
  confirming the "don't push if the URL already matches" guard actually prevents history spam, not just
  in theory.
- An unknown issue key (`/browse/TH-9999`) shows the pre-existing "issue not found" error banner inside
  the drawer rather than crashing or leaving the app unusable -- the existing `openIssue` error handling
  needed no changes to cover this new entry path.
- Confirmed the new route carries the same `Content-Security-Policy`/`X-Frame-Options` headers as `/`.
- Re-ran both existing browser regression scripts (`login_browser_test.mjs`,
  `reorder_move_bulk_test.mjs`) unchanged -- both passed, including the move-issue scenario that already
  exercises `openIssue` with a freshly-changed key after a mutation.
- `ctest --output-on-failure`: 8/8 green (no database-layer code touched).

## 2026-08-03 — Rename the "Selected" workflow status to "Confirmed" (user-requested)

A pure display-label change, requested directly by the user. `002_seed_demo.sql`'s `issue_statuses` seed
row for `status_key = 'selected'` had `name = 'Selected'`; changed to `name = 'Confirmed'` in both the
SQLite and PostgreSQL seed files. `status_key` (the internal identifier used throughout application logic,
filters, and tests) is unchanged -- only the human-facing label changed. `web/app.js`'s client-side
`STATUSES` constant (used to populate status dropdowns/filters without a round-trip) was updated to match.

This seed file is explicitly documented (`docs/SCHEMA.md`) as "an explicitly invoked, idempotent
development seed rather than a schema migration" -- filenames containing `_seed_` are excluded from the
checksummed `schema_migrations` tracking (`discoverMigrationFiles` in `Migration.cpp` skips them
outright), and the file has been edited directly at every phase that needed new seed rows throughout this
project's history. CLAUDE.md's "never edit an applied migration" rule targets the checksummed schema
migrations that rule protects; it does not apply to this file, consistent with established practice.

### Verification

- Reseeded a fresh SQLite database and confirmed via a direct API read (`GET /api/v1/issues`) that the
  `selected`-status issue now reports `name: "Confirmed"`.
- Browser-verified: the Kanban board's column header now reads "CONFIRMED" (was "SELECTED"), and the
  issues-list status filter dropdown's option text is "Confirmed".
- Reseeded a fresh **live PostgreSQL** database (this touches seed data shared by both database adapters)
  and confirmed via `psql` that `issue_statuses` now has `name = 'Confirmed'` for `status_key = 'selected'`.
- `ctest --output-on-failure`: 8/8 green (no test asserts on this status's specific display name; only its
  key, which is unchanged).

## 2026-08-03 — Bulk Done-status picker and keyboard multi-select (post-V1, user-requested)

The fourth batch of optional, non-roadmap follow-up, and the last two items on the remaining-work list --
picked together when the user was asked which to do next. Both are `web/`-only UI polish; neither touches
the backend.

### What changed

**Bulk Done-status picker.** `GET`/bulk `POST /api/v1/issues/bulk/status` already accepted an optional
`resolution` field and forwarded it per-issue to the same `changeStatus` call the single-issue path uses
(`TicketService::bulkChangeStatus` -> `changeStatus(key, statusKey, actor, resolution)` per key) -- the
backend has supported this since Phase 4/D68-D70's original implementation. The UI, however, filtered
Done-category statuses out of the bulk status picker entirely (`bulkStatusOptions` excluded
`status.category === 'done'`), so there was no way to reach it. Fixed by:
- Including every status in `bulkStatusOptions` again.
- A new `#bulk-resolution-select` next to the status picker, hidden by default, populated from the
  existing `RESOLUTIONS` constant (the same one the drawer/board resolution pickers already use).
- A `change` listener on the status picker toggles the resolution picker's visibility based on whether the
  newly-selected status is Done-category (`refreshBulkResolutionVisibility`), mirroring the exact same
  reveal-on-selection pattern the drawer's `#drawer-status`/`#drawer-resolution-row` already uses.
- The bulk-apply handler includes `resolution` in the request payload only when the selected status is
  Done-category. The bulk semantics are unchanged: `succeeded`/`failed` per issue, no rollback on partial
  failure (e.g. an issue with an unfinished sub-task still fails that one row, per D68, while the rest of
  the batch succeeds).

**Keyboard-driven multi-select.** The issue table's row checkboxes (`.issue-select`) already supported
basic single-checkbox keyboard toggling for free (native `<input type="checkbox">` semantics: Tab to
focus, Space to toggle) -- what was actually missing was a way to select a *range* without the mouse, and
a quick way to select every visible row. Added:
- A "select all" checkbox in the table header (`#select-all-issues`), toggling every visible row's
  checkbox and syncing to a checked/unchecked/indeterminate tri-state based on the current selection (all
  selected -> checked; some selected -> indeterminate; none -> unchecked) -- itself already fully keyboard
  -operable natively (Tab, Space), no custom keyboard handling needed.
- Shift+click range select on a row checkbox: checks (or unchecks, matching the clicked box's new state)
  every row between the last-clicked checkbox and the current one -- the common "range select" convention
  from file managers/email clients. Tracked via a `lastCheckedIndex` closure variable, reset whenever the
  bulk bar's "Clear" button runs or the header checkbox is used.
- Shift+ArrowDown/ArrowUp on a focused checkbox: checks the next/previous row and moves focus to it,
  extending a range one row at a time without the mouse at all -- the genuinely keyboard-only path the
  shift-click convention above doesn't provide by itself.
- `aria-label`s added to both the header and per-row checkboxes (`"Select all issues"`, `"Select TH-1"`
  etc.) -- they had no accessible name before beyond their position in the row.

### Verification

- Browser-verified with Playwright/Chromium:
  - Selecting two non-Done issues, choosing "Done" in the bulk status picker, confirming the resolution
    picker appears, picking a resolution, and applying: both issues moved to Done with the exact same
    resolution value, confirmed via a direct API read after the UI action (`psql`-equivalent for SQLite --
    `GET /api/v1/issues`).
  - The resolution picker correctly hides again when switching the bulk status picker back to a non-Done
    status, and starts hidden by default.
  - The header select-all checkbox checks/unchecks all six visible rows and toggles the bulk bar's
    visibility correctly both ways.
  - Shift-click from one row's checkbox to another (skipping the ones in between) correctly checks every
    row in between, not just the two endpoints.
  - Keyboard-only path: focused the first checkbox, pressed Space (native toggle) to check it, then two
    consecutive Shift+ArrowDown presses -- confirmed the selection count grew by one per press and that
    keyboard focus moved along with each extension (not left behind on the first checkbox).
  - Confirmed the pre-existing regression guard still holds: clicking a checkbox never opens the issue
    drawer (the existing `stopPropagation` on checkbox clicks, now shared with the new shift-click range
    logic, is unaffected).
  - Screenshotted the bulk resolution picker in dark mode and a mid-range-select state in light mode --
    both render correctly with no unstyled elements (the new markup reuses `.bulk-bar select`/`.issue-
    select` styling verbatim, no new CSS was needed).
- Re-ran both existing browser regression scripts (`login_browser_test.mjs`, `reorder_move_bulk_test.mjs`)
  unchanged -- both passed.
- `ctest --output-on-failure`: 8/8 green (no C++ source touched, only `web/app.js`).

This closes out the full list of optional, non-roadmap follow-up items that were identified when the
reduced-scope V1 roadmap closed.

## 2026-08-03 — Kanban board drag-and-drop (post-V1, user-requested)

The third batch of optional, non-roadmap follow-up. The board was already usable end-to-end via the issue
drawer's status dropdown; this adds a faster, direct way to move a card between columns without opening
the drawer -- explicitly optional UX polish (not required by D32/D33, which only need a soft WIP-limit
*display*), picked by explicit user choice.

### What changed

- `web/app.js`'s `renderBoard()`: every `.issue-card` gained `draggable="true"`; every `.board-list`
  (the column's card container) gained `data-status-key="<status key>"` so a drop target can be resolved
  without re-deriving it from the column header text.
- New `bindBoardDragAndDrop()`, called after every board render (mirrors the existing pattern of re-
  binding handlers after each `innerHTML` replacement, same as `bindIssueLinks()`): wires `dragstart`/
  `dragend` on cards (stashes the dragged issue's key via `DataTransfer`, toggles a `.dragging` class for
  visual feedback) and `dragover`/`dragleave`/`drop` on each column's card list (toggles a `.drag-over`
  class while hovering, so the highlighted target is visible before the drop even lands).
- New `handleBoardDrop(issueKey, targetStatusKey)`: a no-op if dropped on the same column; otherwise
  resolves the dropped issue from `state.issues` (no extra fetch -- the board already holds the full list)
  and either applies the status change directly or, if the target is a Done-category status and the issue
  has no resolution yet, opens a resolution prompt first -- exactly the same D68-D70 rule the drawer's
  status dropdown already enforces, just reached by a different interaction.
- New `applyBoardStatusChange(issueKey, statusKey, resolution, expectedVersion)`: the same
  `PATCH /api/v1/issues/{key}/status` call the drawer's `applyStatusChange` already makes, but re-renders
  the board and shows a toast instead of opening the issue drawer afterward -- jumping into the detail
  view is the right follow-up after a deliberate dropdown change, but not after a quick drag; a failed
  request also re-renders the board so a stale/conflicting card doesn't linger in the wrong-looking spot.
- New `promptBoardResolution(issue, targetStatusKey)`: a small dialog built the same way the app already
  builds transient UI that isn't worth pre-declaring in `index.html` (e.g. the notification panel) --
  reuses the existing `.modal-backdrop`/`.modal` CSS classes (same look as the create-issue/create-project
  modals) rather than introducing new modal styling, with its own click-outside-to-close and Escape-to-
  close handling (added/removed on open/close, not part of the app's shared global Escape handler, since
  this dialog doesn't live in the static DOM).
- New CSS: `.issue-card.dragging` (dims the source card while dragging) and `.board-list.drag-over`
  (a dashed outline + tinted background on the column currently being hovered over), both built from
  existing theme variables so both light and dark mode render correctly with no new color literals.
- No backend, schema, or API changes -- this is a new client for the existing
  `PATCH /api/v1/issues/{key}/status` route, unchanged since Phase 3.

### Verification

- Browser-verified with Playwright/Chromium. Playwright's built-in `locator.dragTo()` helper turned out to
  be unreliable for longer-distance HTML5 drag simulation in headless Chromium specifically (confirmed by
  isolating the failure: short adjacent-column drags worked consistently, but a Backlog-to-Done drag
  consistently failed to fire `dragover` on the actual target, regardless of viewport width or retry count
  -- a known category of Playwright/headless-Chromium limitation with native HTML5 DnD, not a bug in this
  feature). Switched to a manual multi-step `page.mouse.move`/`down`/`up` simulation for the verification
  script, which reproduced every scenario reliably and repeatedly:
  - A card dragged into a different, non-Done column moves immediately, shows a confirmation toast, and
    the board's column counts update.
  - A card dropped back onto its own current column is a no-op: no toast, no API call.
  - A card dragged into the Done column without an existing resolution shows the resolution prompt instead
    of moving immediately; the card visibly stays in its original column until the prompt is resolved.
  - Canceling the prompt leaves the card exactly where it was (no partial state change).
  - Confirming a resolution in the prompt applies the status change, closes the prompt, shows the toast,
    and the card appears in the Done column.
  - Both the drag-over highlight and the resolution prompt were screenshotted in both light and dark mode
    (`colorScheme` emulation) -- both render correctly with no unstyled elements, confirming the reused
    `.modal-backdrop`/`.modal` classes and the new CSS variables-only drag styles theme correctly.
- Re-ran both existing browser regression scripts (`login_browser_test.mjs`, `reorder_move_bulk_test.mjs`)
  unchanged -- both passed, confirming no regression from the board markup/event-wiring changes.
- `ctest --output-on-failure`: 8/8 green (no C++ source touched, only `web/`).

Not attempted: a formal accessibility equivalent for the drag gesture itself (native HTML5 drag-and-drop
has no built-in keyboard operability). This is a deliberate, documented gap, not an oversight -- moving a
card between columns remains fully keyboard-operable via the issue drawer's status dropdown (verified as
part of the D47 accessibility baseline pass), so drag-and-drop is an additional fast path, not the only
path, and does not regress the baseline established there.

## 2026-08-02 — Re-typing and re-parenting an issue after creation (post-V1, user-requested)

The second batch of optional, non-roadmap follow-up (see the account-settings entry below for the first),
again started only after the user was asked to pick one. Closes the one deliberate gap that had persisted
since Phase 3: `TicketService::editIssue` previously never touched `issueTypeKey`/`parentIssueKey`, and
`moveIssue` (D37) still deliberately does not re-parent/un-parent as part of a project move.

### What changed

- `Domain::EditIssueRequest` gained `issueTypeKey` (required, like `CreateIssueRequest`'s) and
  `parentIssueKey` (optional, same semantics as at creation).
- `TicketService::requireValidHierarchy` (create-only) was refactored into a shared
  `validateHierarchyShape(issueTypeKey, parentIssueKey, projectKey, excludeSelfKey)` used by both
  `createIssue` and the new `editIssue` hierarchy check -- same fixed rules (D5/D29/D64-D66): an Epic
  cannot have a parent, a Sub-task must have one, a parent must exist in the same project, a Sub-task's
  parent must be a Story/Task/Bug, a Story/Task/Bug's optional parent must be an Epic. The edit path adds
  one rule create-time doesn't need: an issue cannot become its own parent (`excludeSelfKey`).
- The one rule that depends on *concurrent database state* rather than pure input shape -- whether
  retyping across hierarchy levels (Epic <-> Story/Task/Bug <-> Sub-task) would leave existing children
  invalid -- is checked transactionally inside `IDatabase::editIssue` in both adapters, not in
  `TicketService`, for the same race-safety reason `moveIssue`'s existing "has children" check already
  lives in the database adapter rather than the application layer: a child inserted concurrently between
  a TicketService-side check and the update would otherwise slip past it. Same-level retyping (e.g.
  Task -> Bug, both hierarchy level 0) is always allowed regardless of children, since it never changes
  what any parent/child relationship requires from this issue.
- Both `SqliteDatabase::editIssue` and `PostgresDatabase::editIssue` extended: the current-state read now
  also fetches the old type key and old parent key (for hierarchy-level comparison and history), the
  child-count check (`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM issues WHERE parent_issue_id = ? AND deleted_at IS NULL`,
  identical query `moveIssue` already used) runs only when the hierarchy level is actually changing, the
  `UPDATE` statement now also sets `issue_type_id`/`parent_issue_id`, and two new `issue_history` rows
  (`issue_type`, `parent`) are recorded exactly like every other edited field, only when the value
  actually changed.
- `TicketService::editRequestFrom` (the internal helper that carries every current field forward unchanged
  for the bulk-assign/bulk-label single-field actions, since `editIssue` is a full-replacement PUT) now
  also carries `issueTypeKey`/`parentIssueKey` forward, so bulk actions continue to leave type/parent
  untouched exactly as before this change.
- `PUT /api/v1/issues/{key}` (the PATCH-named route implementing the full-replacement edit) now parses
  `issueTypeKey`/`parentIssueKey` from the request body.
- `web/app.js`: the issue drawer's edit form gained a Type select and a Parent/Epic picker (`refreshEditParentOptions`,
  mirroring the existing create-modal's `refreshCreateParentOptions` -- same label text switching
  ("Epic (optional)" vs "Parent (required)"), same server-side-filtered candidate list, adapted for a
  fixed project and excluding the issue itself from its own candidate-parent list), wired into the save
  payload.
- `Domain::validateEditIssue` gained an `issueTypeKey is required` check, matching `validateCreateIssue`.
  **Deliberately not defaulted** to `"task"` the way `CreateIssueRequest::issueTypeKey` defaults for
  convenience -- silently defaulting an *edit* request's missing type would risk silently retyping any
  non-Task issue to Task for any caller that forgot to set the field, which is a far worse failure mode
  than an explicit 400.

### Verification

- New test block in `tests/workflow_integration_tests.cpp` (SQLite, via `TicketService`): same-level
  retyping (Story -> Bug) always succeeds; re-parenting alone (type unchanged) moves a story between
  epics and can clear the parent entirely; an epic still cannot gain a parent via edit; a sub-task still
  cannot lose its parent via edit; self-parenting is rejected; a cross-project parent is rejected at edit
  time; retyping across hierarchy levels succeeds for a childless issue (simultaneously setting/clearing
  the parent in the same edit, exactly as create-time requires); retyping across hierarchy levels is
  rejected while the issue has children; same-level retyping is unaffected by having children. All new
  assertions pass.
- Three existing direct `EditIssueRequest` construction sites (`tests/authorization_integration_tests.cpp`
  x4, `tests/sqlite_integration_tests.cpp` x1) needed `issueTypeKey` added once the field became required
  -- each set to the actual current type of the issue being edited, confirming the tests still exercise
  real, valid edits rather than being loosened to compensate.
- Live-verified end-to-end over the real HTTP API against **live PostgreSQL** (not just SQLite, since this
  touches both database adapters): started the server against a fresh local PostgreSQL 16 instance,
  created an Epic, retyped it to Task with no children (succeeded, `200`), created a second Epic with a
  Story child and confirmed retyping it across levels was rejected (`400`, the exact "has child issues"
  message), then re-parented the story to a third Epic (succeeded, `200`) and confirmed both an
  `issue_type` and a `parent` row landed in `issue_history` with the correct old/new values via a direct
  `psql` query.
- Browser-verified with Playwright/Chromium: the edit form's Type select and Parent/Epic picker render
  correctly and react to type changes (parent field hides for Epic, shows "Epic (optional)" for Story/
  Task/Bug, shows "Parent (required)" and a populated candidate list for Sub-task); saving a valid
  cross-level retype (childless Epic -> Task) succeeds and the drawer's type badge updates; saving a
  retype that the server rejects (an Epic with a child, retyped to Task) shows the server's exact error
  message in the edit form's error banner without silently reverting or losing the in-progress edit.
  Screenshots reviewed for both the Task-type and Sub-task-type edit form states.
- Re-ran both existing browser regression scripts (`login_browser_test.mjs`,
  `reorder_move_bulk_test.mjs`) unchanged -- both passed, including the bulk-label action (which now
  routes through the updated `editRequestFrom`), confirming no regression.
- `ctest --output-on-failure`: 8/8 green. Full three-configuration build matrix (default SQLite+
  PostgreSQL+server, `-DTICKETHUB_WITH_POSTGRES=OFF` SQLite-only, `-DTICKETHUB_WITH_SQLITE=OFF`
  PostgreSQL-only) reconfirmed to compile clean (transient build directories, removed after verification).

## 2026-08-02 — Account settings web UI: personal access tokens and active sessions (post-V1, user-requested)

The reduced-scope V1 roadmap (`docs/REDUCED_SCOPE_ROADMAP.md`) closed with the prior entry below. This is
the first batch of the explicitly optional, non-roadmap follow-up work listed at the end of `NEXT.md`,
started only after the user was directly asked which optional item to pick up next and chose this one --
per `CLAUDE.md`'s autonomy rule, none of the optional items were to be started without that. Personal
access tokens (D39/D40) and active sessions (D54) have had a complete REST API and CLI-equivalent story
since Phase 6; the only gap was a `web/` screen to use them from, called out explicitly in every Phase 8
completion note ("No web UI yet for managing tokens or sessions").

### What changed

- New "Account" item in the sidebar nav (`web/index.html`, always visible to every authenticated user --
  unlike the admin-only Audit log/Attachment recycle bin items, tokens and sessions are scoped to the
  caller's own account, not installation-wide).
- New `renderAccountView()` in `web/app.js`, wired into `renderCurrentView()`'s existing view dispatch:
  - **Personal access tokens** panel: lists every token (name, created, expires, last used, Active/Revoked
    status chip) via `GET /api/v1/tokens`. A "New token" button reveals an inline name/expires-in-days
    form (`POST /api/v1/tokens`); on success the raw token -- returned by the API exactly once (D40) -- is
    shown in a dismissible, success-colored callout with a "Copy" button
    (`navigator.clipboard.writeText`), then cleared from in-memory state so navigating away and back never
    re-shows it. Each active (non-revoked) token gets a "Revoke" button (`DELETE /api/v1/tokens/{id}`).
  - **Active sessions** panel: lists every session (signed-in time, expiry) via `GET /api/v1/sessions`,
    tagging the caller's current session with a "This device" badge. A "Sign out everywhere else" button
    (`POST /api/v1/sessions/sign-out-others`) appears only when there is more than one session, and is
    wired to the existing endpoint that always preserves the caller's own session while invalidating every
    other one.
  - No new backend routes, no schema change -- this batch is entirely `web/` (`index.html`/`app.js`/
    `styles.css`), consuming REST endpoints that have existed and been tested since the Phase 6 batch.
- New `.token-reveal-panel`/`.token-reveal-value` CSS rules in `web/styles.css`, built entirely from the
  existing `--success-bg`/`--success-text` theme variables (from the D46 dark-theme batch), so it renders
  correctly in both light and dark mode with no new color literals.

### Verification

Playwright/Chromium end-to-end against a running instance:

- Account view loads; empty-tokens state renders correctly.
- Created a token: the raw value is shown once (confirmed 64 hex characters, matching the 32-byte
  `randomTokenHex` token format), the new row appears with an "Active" status chip, the Copy button
  populates the clipboard (verified via granted clipboard permissions) and shows a confirmation toast.
- Navigated away and back to the Account view: confirmed the reveal panel does **not** reappear (the raw
  value is genuinely shown only once, matching D40).
- Revoked the token: status chip flips to "Revoked" and its Revoke button disappears.
- Two-context session test (two separate browser contexts, i.e. two real cookie jars, logged in as the
  same user): confirmed both sessions listed from either device, confirmed "Sign out everywhere else" is
  hidden with only one session and appears with two, confirmed clicking it from device A shows a
  `"Signed out 1 other session(s)"` toast, confirmed device A's own session survives (its next page load
  still works), and confirmed device B is bounced to the login screen on its next API call -- i.e. the
  other session was genuinely invalidated server-side, not just hidden in the UI.
- Re-ran both existing browser regression scripts (`login_browser_test.mjs`, `reorder_move_bulk_test.mjs`)
  unchanged against the same instance -- both passed, confirming the new always-visible nav item didn't
  disturb any existing view's layout or behavior.
- Reviewed screenshots of the token list, the create-token form, and the reveal panel in both light and
  dark mode -- all correctly themed with no unstyled elements.
- No C++ source was touched in this batch, so `ctest`/the build matrix were not re-run; the prior entry
  below already confirms 8/8 green on the codebase this batch built on top of.

## 2026-08-02 — Threat-model / security self-review: Phase 8 slice 4 (closes Milestone 4)

The last open Phase 8 item, and with it the whole reduced-scope V1 roadmap: `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md` is the
full write-up (scope, method, every finding, what was fixed, what's accepted residual risk, and what this
review did not cover). This entry records how each fix was verified.

### What changed

A dedicated code-reading pass across the entire HTTP attack surface (`src/web/Api.cpp`'s 46 mutating
routes and all read routes, every `TicketService`/`AuthService` authorization check, both database
adapters' query construction, attachment storage, and `web/app.js`'s escaping/CSRF handling) found and
fixed five issues, ranked by severity in `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md`:

1. **Broken access control (IDOR), High severity**: `editComment`/`deleteComment`/`editWorklog`/
   `deleteWorklog`/`deleteAttachment` in `src/application/TicketService.cpp` checked the project-role
   requirement against the issue named in the URL but looked up the target comment/worklog/attachment
   purely by its own id, never confirming the resource actually belonged to that issue. Since every
   project is readable by every authenticated user (D58), this let a project Member/Admin of *any* one
   project reach and mutate a comment/worklog/attachment belonging to a *different* project they have no
   role on, by routing the request through one of their own issues' URLs. Fixed by comparing the looked-up
   resource's `issueId` against the URL-resolved issue's `id` before proceeding, treating a mismatch the
   same as "not found" (matches the existing unknown-id convention already used by these same methods).
2. **CSRF cookie derived from the session token, Medium severity**: the non-`HttpOnly` `th_csrf` cookie was
   literally the session token's first 16 bytes, hex-encoded -- unnecessary, since `csrfTokenValid` only
   ever compares cookie-to-header verbatim, and it meant any future cookie-read primitive could leak part
   of the `HttpOnly` session secret through the intentionally-JS-readable cookie. Fixed by generating the
   CSRF token independently via `Common::randomTokenHex(16)`.
3. **Login timing side-channel, Low/Medium severity**: the not-found/inactive-email branch of
   `AuthService::login` skipped the slow Argon2id verify that the wrong-password branch always runs,
   letting response time distinguish "no such account" from "wrong password" despite an identical error
   message -- enabling email enumeration. Fixed with a lazily-computed dummy password hash the not-found
   branch now verifies against (result discarded) before throwing, equalizing the dominant cost gap.
4. **Logout missing CSRF check, Low severity**: the only one of 46 mutating routes without a
   `csrfTokenValid` check. Not presently exploitable (`th_session` is `SameSite=Strict`, already blocking
   cross-site attachment of the cookie), but a latent inconsistency. Fixed for defense in depth.
5. **CSV/formula injection in export, Low/Medium severity**: `csvField` in `src/web/Api.cpp` didn't
   neutralize fields starting with `=`/`+`/`-`/`@`, so a malicious issue summary/description/label could
   execute as a spreadsheet formula when the CSV export (D48) was opened in Excel/Sheets/Calc. Fixed with
   the standard OWASP mitigation: a leading apostrophe forces plain-text interpretation.

`docs/THREAT_MODEL.md` also documents what was reviewed and confirmed already correct (password hashing
parameters, session/PAT secret storage, SQL parameterization throughout both adapters, consistent
client-side XSS escaping including the earlier Phase 6 stored-XSS fix, path-traversal-proof attachment
storage, shell-escaped backup/restore commands, and the anonymous-read toggle never weakening write
authorization), and three deliberate residual risks already implied by earlier fixed-scope decisions
(unscoped PATs per D39/D40, reverse-proxy-unaware per-IP rate limiting per D124/D125, and no socket-level
request-body cap -- all restated there rather than treated as new findings, since fixing them would mean
overriding decisions already made, not closing an oversight).

### Verification

- **IDOR fix**: reproduced live against a running instance before the fix (an authenticated user with a
  role on Project A successfully edited a comment belonging to Project B by substituting a Project A issue
  key into the URL, receiving `200`); confirmed fixed after the code change (`404 Comment not found`,
  matching the existing unknown-resource response). New regression tests added to
  `tests/authorization_integration_tests.cpp` for all three resource types (comments/worklogs/
  attachments), covering both the cross-project attack path and confirming the ordinary role check still
  applies correctly when a resource is addressed through its own issue's URL.
- **CSRF-cookie independence**: confirmed live via `Set-Cookie` headers from `/api/v1/auth/login` that the
  `th_csrf` and `th_session` values no longer share a prefix, and that CSRF-protected writes still succeed
  using the new independently-generated token.
- **Login timing fix**: confirmed both the wrong-password and unknown-email cases still return `401` with
  the identical message, and correct login is unaffected.
- **Logout CSRF check**: confirmed live that logout without `X-CSRF-Token` now returns `403`, and still
  succeeds with the correct header.
- **CSV injection fix**: confirmed live that an issue summary of `=cmd|'/c calc'!A1` now exports as
  `'=cmd|'/c calc'!A1` (apostrophe-prefixed) rather than the raw formula.
- `ctest --output-on-failure`: 8/8 green, including the three new IDOR regression assertions.
- Full three-configuration build matrix reconfirmed clean after these changes: the default SQLite+
  PostgreSQL+server config, a fresh `-DTICKETHUB_WITH_POSTGRES=OFF` (SQLite-only) config, and a fresh
  `-DTICKETHUB_WITH_SQLITE=OFF` (PostgreSQL-only) config all compile with no errors (transient build
  directories, removed after verification).

Not independently re-verified against live PostgreSQL: none of these five fixes touch either database
adapter (`PostgresDatabase.cpp`/`SqliteDatabase.cpp`) -- the IDOR fix only compares fields already returned
by existing, unmodified `findCommentById`/`findWorklogById`/`findAttachmentById` queries, and the other
four fixes are entirely in the web/application layer. The PostgreSQL-only build was confirmed to compile,
which is the applicable check for a change with no new or altered SQL.

**This closes Phase 8, Milestone 4, and the entire reduced-scope V1 roadmap** (`docs/
REDUCED_SCOPE_ROADMAP.md`'s exit gate: `docker compose up` produces a usable, documented V1 instance --
done; all supported build configurations compile and pass tests -- confirmed above; no known open security
issue from the hardening pass -- every finding from this review is now either fixed or explicitly
documented as an accepted, decision-consistent residual risk in `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md`).

## 2026-08-02 — Accessibility baseline pass and browser-support note (D47/D139): Phase 8 slice 3

Still open in Phase 8: the threat-model/security self-review and a final documentation-currency pass.

### What changed

- **D47 (accessibility):** reviewed `web/index.html`/`web/app.js` against D47's V1 bar -- "reasonable
  baseline accessibility (semantic HTML, keyboard operability) without committing to or tracking a formal
  WCAG level or dedicated audit deliverable". Semantic HTML was already largely in place from earlier
  phases (`<nav aria-label>`, `<main>`/`<aside>`/`<header>` landmarks, `<label>`-wrapped form inputs,
  `role="dialog" aria-modal aria-labelledby` on both modals, `aria-label` on icon-only buttons,
  `aria-live="polite"` on the main content region). The one real gap found: several of the most-used
  click targets in the UI -- issue table rows, Kanban board cards, project cards, and inline issue-key
  cross-reference links -- were only wired up via a bare `element.addEventListener('click', ...)` on a
  plain `<tr>`/`<article>`/`<span>`, with no `tabindex`, no `role`, and no keyboard handler, so a
  keyboard-only user could not reach or activate them at all.
  - Fixed with a new shared `makeKeyboardActivatable(element, activate)` helper in `web/app.js`: sets
    `tabIndex = 0`, adds `role="link"` (only if the element doesn't already carry a role), and listens for
    `Enter`/`Space` on `keydown`, guarded by `event.target !== element` so keydown events bubbling up from
    an already-independently-operable nested control (the bulk-select checkbox, the reorder up/down
    buttons, the per-card archive/delete/restore buttons -- all already `stopPropagation()`-guarded against
    the same accidental-bubbling problem for mouse clicks) can never double-fire. Wired into the existing
    `bindIssueLinks()` (covers issue rows, board cards, and inline key references in one place, since they
    already shared one click-binding function) and into the project-card click binding in
    `renderProjectsView`.
  - `web/styles.css` gained a small rule (`[role="link"][tabindex="0"]:focus-visible { outline: 2px solid
    var(--primary); outline-offset: -2px; }`) so the newly-focusable elements get a visible focus
    indicator consistent with the rest of the UI's `--primary` accent color; nothing pre-existing sets a
    blanket `outline: none`, so this is additive, not a fix to a suppressed default.
  - Deliberately not attempted: a formal WCAG 2.2 AA audit, automated contrast-ratio tooling, or a
    screen-reader-software pass -- D47 explicitly drops that deliverable for V1. Decorative emoji glyphs
    inside already-`aria-label`led icon buttons and inside plain nav-item text were left as-is (the
    `aria-label` already provides the accessible name where one is set; where it is not, the emoji is
    followed by real label text, which is a minor screen-reader verbosity issue, not a blocker).
- **D139 (browser support):** re-confirmed, no code change needed -- `web/app.js` uses no framework and no
  polyfilled/transpiled syntax (`fetch`, template literals, arrow functions, `async`/`await`, optional
  chaining, `classList`, `FormData` -- all supported unmodified by the last two major versions of Chrome/
  Firefox/Edge/Safari), so D139's "confirmed unchanged... natural consequence of modern vanilla JS without
  polyfills" is satisfied by construction, matching the decision register's own reasoning exactly. This
  batch's documentation update is the only artifact for D139.

### Verification

- New Playwright/Chromium script (`a11y_keyboard_test.mjs`, scratchpad-only, not committed): logs in,
  `Tab`-focuses (via `.focus()`, equivalent to keyboard-only traversal reaching the element) an issue
  table row and confirms `document.activeElement` is that exact row, presses `Enter`, confirms the issue
  drawer opens, presses `Escape`, confirms it closes; focuses a Kanban board card and confirms `Space`
  opens the drawer; focuses a project card and confirms `Enter` navigates to that project's board. Also
  re-confirmed the pre-existing stopPropagation guard on the bulk-select checkbox still holds (clicking it
  does not also open the issue drawer) -- i.e. the new keyboard wiring did not introduce a mouse-click
  regression. All checks passed.
- Re-ran the existing `login_browser_test.mjs` and `reorder_move_bulk_test.mjs` Playwright regression
  scripts unchanged -- both passed, confirming no functional regression.
- `ctest --output-on-failure`: 8/8 green (no application/domain/database code touched, only `web/`).

Not independently verified: a formal automated accessibility scanner (e.g. axe-core) run, or manual
testing with actual screen-reader software (VoiceOver/NVDA/JAWS) -- consistent with D47's explicitly
reduced V1 scope, this was a targeted fix for the one concrete keyboard-operability gap found, not a
certified audit.

## 2026-08-02 — Light and dark theme (D46): Phase 8 slice 2

CSS-only batch, no C++/schema/route changes. Still open in Phase 8: the baseline accessibility review
(D47), the browser-support note (D139, already satisfied by construction), the threat-model/security
self-review, and a final documentation-currency pass.

### What changed

- `web/styles.css`'s `:root` gained a set of new CSS custom properties that were previously missing
  (`--surface-hover`, `--text-secondary`, `--info-bg`/`--info-text`, `--success-bg`/`--success-text`,
  `--danger-bg`/`--danger-border`, `--warning-bg`/`--warning-border`/`--warning-text`, `--overlay`,
  `--topbar-bg`) and `color-scheme: light dark;`, so native form controls (checkboxes, date pickers, the
  default focus ring) follow the OS dark-mode signal automatically even before any custom override is
  applied.
- A new `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) { :root { ... } }` block redefines every theme variable with
  a dark-appropriate value (`--bg: #12151c`, `--surface: #1c212c`, `--text: #e4e8f1`, `--primary:
  #579dff`, etc.) -- D46 calls for "light and dark theme... simple", with no high-contrast/branding
  requirement and no mention of a manual in-app toggle, so this deliberately follows the OS-level
  `prefers-color-scheme` signal only; there is no persisted user preference or UI switch, since building
  one would be new state/UI machinery the decision text does not call for.
- Roughly 30 hardcoded literal colors scattered through the stylesheet were converted to reference the
  variables above instead (`background: white` -> `var(--surface)` across ~15 rules; `color: #44546f` ->
  `var(--text-secondary)` across ~8 rules; plus targeted fixes for status/priority/label chips, unread
  notifications, the bulk-action bar, form/error banners, the update banner, modal/drawer backdrops, the
  filter bar, board columns, issue-table hover/border colors, the over-WIP-limit column count, ghost
  buttons, small avatars, the loading spinner, and the inline WIP-limit editor). Left deliberately
  unconverted: the sidebar (a fixed navy `#0b214a`, always dark by design regardless of theme), `.avatar`/
  `.project-avatar` (fixed colored badges with their own contrasting fixed text), and `.toast` (a fixed
  dark overlay) -- all three are self-contained and stay readable in both themes without needing to track
  the page theme.
- Found and fixed a real bug during verification: `.link-form input` (the "Issue key, e.g. TH-3" field in
  the issue-linking UI) had no explicit `background`/`color` at all, so in dark mode it fell back to the
  browser's light default form-control appearance -- a white box that was hard to read against the rest of
  the now-dark page. Fixed by adding explicit `background: var(--surface); color: var(--text);`, matching
  every other form input in the stylesheet.

### Verification

Ran a Playwright/Chromium script (`dark_theme_test.mjs`, scratchpad-only, not committed) that logs in and
emulates both `colorScheme: 'light'` and `colorScheme: 'dark'` at the browser level:

- Confirmed light mode is byte-identical to before this change (computed `body` background, `.content`
  text color, and `.panel` background all matched the pre-existing light-theme values).
- Confirmed dark mode correctly switches: computed `body` background resolved to `rgb(18, 21, 28)`,
  matching the new `--bg: #12151c` variable, and the issue drawer's background switched accordingly too.
- Took screenshots of five views in dark mode -- the Issues list, the issue drawer, the create-issue
  modal, the Kanban board, and the Projects grid -- and reviewed each image directly, confirming all text/
  chip/border contrast is readable and no element is left with a stray light-mode background. This is how
  the `.link-form input` bug above was actually caught: a screenshot of the issue drawer with the "Link
  issue" panel open showed a plainly-wrong white input box against the dark surface.
- Re-ran the existing `login_browser_test.mjs` and `reorder_move_bulk_test.mjs` Playwright regression
  scripts unchanged -- both passed, confirming this CSS-only change caused no functional regression.
- `ctest --output-on-failure`: 8/8 green (unaffected by construction -- no C++ source changed).

Not independently verified: automated contrast-ratio (WCAG) measurement -- deferred to the upcoming
accessibility baseline review (D47), which is the next item in Phase 8.

## 2026-08-02 — Docker image and Compose distribution (D50): Phase 8 slice 1

First Phase 8 (Milestone 4) slice, directly following the close of Phase 7/Milestone 3. Still open in
Phase 8: light/dark theme (D46, currently light-only), the baseline accessibility review (D47), the
browser-support note (D139, already satisfied by construction -- modern vanilla JS, no polyfills), the
threat-model/security self-review, and a final documentation-currency pass.

### What changed

- New two-stage `Dockerfile`. `build` stage: `debian:bookworm-slim` plus the exact build dependencies
  README.md's own "Building" section already documents (`build-essential cmake libpq-dev libsqlite3-dev
  libargon2-dev libasio-dev`, plus `git`/`ca-certificates` for Crow's network-fetched CMake
  `FetchContent`), configures with `-DTICKETHUB_BUILD_SERVER=ON` (which also builds the CLI, since
  `TICKETHUB_BUILD_CLI` defaults `ON`), and runs `cmake --install build --prefix /opt/ticket-hub`.
  `runtime` stage: the same base image with only the shared libraries needed at runtime (`libpq5
  libsqlite3-0 libargon2-1`) plus `curl` (for the `HEALTHCHECK` below), a non-root `ticket-hub` system
  user, and `COPY --from=build /opt/ticket-hub /opt/ticket-hub`.
- `src/config/Config.cpp`'s compiled-in defaults for `TICKETHUB_WEB_ROOT`/`TICKETHUB_MIGRATIONS_ROOT`
  point at the *build machine's* source checkout (`TICKETHUB_SOURCE_DIR`, a compile-time macro) -- this
  does not exist in the runtime image, so the Dockerfile sets both explicitly via `ENV` to the installed
  `share/ticket-hub/...` paths (README.md already flags this exact gap: "installed deployments should set
  `TICKETHUB_MIGRATIONS_ROOT`..."). `TICKETHUB_ATTACHMENTS_DIR` is similarly set to `/data/attachments`
  (a dedicated `VOLUME`), since its default is also cwd-relative.
- `HEALTHCHECK` runs `curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:$TICKETHUB_PORT/api/health` -- a real end-to-end check
  that the HTTP server is actually accepting connections and can talk to its database, not just that the
  process exists.
- New `.dockerignore` (`build/`, `build-*/`, `.git/`, `*.db`/`*.sqlite3`, `data/`) to keep the build
  context small and avoid ever accidentally baking a local SQLite file or build artifacts into an image
  layer.
- `docker-compose.yml` gained a `ticket-hub` service: `build: .` (the new Dockerfile), `depends_on:
  postgres: condition: service_healthy` (waits for Postgres's existing `pg_isready` healthcheck before
  starting), `TICKETHUB_DATABASE_URL` pointed at the `postgres` service by its Compose-internal DNS name
  (not `127.0.0.1`, since from inside the `ticket-hub` container the database is a separate container),
  `TICKETHUB_SEED_DEMO: "false"` by default (a real deployment should not ship pre-seeded demo accounts;
  documented alongside how to create the first real admin or flip the flag for demo data), a
  `ticket-hub-attachments` named volume mounted at `/data`, and its own `HEALTHCHECK`. The existing
  `postgres` service (and its host-published port 5432) is otherwise unchanged, preserving the
  `docker compose up -d postgres`-only workflow README.md's "Run with PostgreSQL" section already
  documents (build from source, run only the database in Docker).

### Verification -- and an explicit disclosure of what could not be tested here

This environment's outbound network access goes through a policy-enforcing agent proxy
(`/root/.ccr/README.md`). Attempting `docker compose build ticket-hub` got past Dockerfile parsing and
manifest resolution for `debian:bookworm-slim` (proving DNS/registry-auth reachability through the proxy
works), but failed pulling the actual image layer blobs with `403 Forbidden` from
`production.cloudfront.docker.com` -- the CDN host Docker Hub's registry redirects layer downloads to.
Confirmed via `curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:39727/__agentproxy/status` that this request *did* reach the
proxy (`recentRelayFailures` shows `connect_rejected` / `gateway answered 403 to CONNECT (policy denial
or upstream failure)` for that exact host, twice, matching two build attempts) -- this is a genuine
organization egress-policy denial on that specific CDN host, not a proxy misconfiguration, a TLS/CA
problem, or a bug in the Dockerfile. Per this environment's own explicit operating rule ("do not retry
organization policy denials (403/407) — report them instead"), this was not retried or routed around
(e.g. no attempt to switch base images, mirror registries, or disable the proxy). This is a report-only
environmental limitation of this specific development sandbox, not a defect in what was written.

Given that constraint, verification focused on everything that *could* be checked without an actual image
build:

1. `docker compose config`: the full merged Compose configuration (both services, healthchecks, the new
   volume, environment variables) parses and resolves cleanly -- confirms YAML/schema correctness.
2. `docker build --check .`: Docker's built-in Dockerfile linter reports "Check complete, no warnings
   found" -- confirms Dockerfile syntax and best-practice conformance (this check runs entirely locally,
   without pulling any image).
3. **Runtime-configuration equivalence test**, run directly on the host: `cmake --install build --prefix
   <dir>` was run standalone and its output tree inspected -- confirmed it produces exactly
   `bin/ticket-hub`, `bin/ticket-hub-cli`, `share/ticket-hub/web/...`, and
   `share/ticket-hub/migrations/{sqlite,postgresql}/...`, i.e. exactly the paths the Dockerfile's `ENV`
   lines assume. The installed `bin/ticket-hub` binary was then run twice with the *exact* environment
   variables the Dockerfile/Compose file set (`TICKETHUB_WEB_ROOT`/`TICKETHUB_MIGRATIONS_ROOT` pointed at
   the installed tree, `TICKETHUB_ATTACHMENTS_DIR` pointed at a fresh directory simulating the `/data`
   volume): once against a fresh SQLite file (confirmed `/api/health` responds, `/` serves the installed
   `index.html`, and the attachments directory is created at the configured path), and once against a
   **live PostgreSQL database** using the *exact* connection-string shape `docker-compose.yml` uses
   (`host=... port=5432 dbname=tickethub user=tickethub password=tickethub-dev`, differing only in
   `host=127.0.0.1` vs `host=postgres` -- purely a DNS-name difference Docker's internal networking
   resolves automatically between Compose services) -- confirmed `/api/health` responds correctly there
   too. Also ran `bin/ticket-hub-cli create-user ... --admin` against the installed binary with the same
   environment, confirming the exact `docker compose exec ticket-hub ticket-hub-cli create-user ...`
   workflow documented in README.md's new "Run with Docker" section actually works end-to-end.
4. `ctest --output-on-failure`: 8/8 green -- this batch added no new C++ source files and changed no
   application code, only packaging files, so the existing suite is unaffected by construction; still run
   to confirm nothing else regressed.

Taken together, this is strong indirect evidence the Dockerfile/Compose file are correct and would build
and run successfully in any environment with ordinary Docker Hub network access -- but it is explicitly
**not** the same as having actually run `docker compose up` end-to-end in a container, and this record
says so precisely rather than implying otherwise.

## 2026-08-02 — Structured JSON logs and admin version banner (D112/D133): Phase 7 slice 2, Phase 7 complete

Second and final Phase 7 slice. Every item in `docs/REDUCED_SCOPE_ROADMAP.md`'s Phase 7 list is now
implemented: backup/restore (D106-D108), the upgrade mechanism (D111, already satisfied by
`ticket-hub-cli migrate`), structured JSON logs to stdout (D133), and the in-app admin version banner
(D112). **This closes Phase 7.**

### What changed -- structured JSON logs (D133)

- New `TicketHub::Web::JsonLogHandler` (`src/web/JsonLogHandler.h/.cpp`), implementing Crow's
  `ILogHandler` interface. `log(message, level)` writes one `crow::json::wvalue` object per call to
  `std::cout` with fields `timestamp` (ISO 8601 UTC, matching the format already used for
  `audit_events`/every migration's `created_at`), `level` (lowercased), `service` (always `"ticket-hub"`),
  and `message` (Crow's own log message text, correctly JSON-escaped by reusing `crow::json::wvalue`'s
  own serializer rather than hand-rolling escaping).
- Registered once in `HttpServer.cpp`'s `runHttpServer`, via `crow::logger::setHandler(&jsonLogHandler)`
  (a `static` local, since Crow's logger keeps a raw non-owning pointer that must outlive `app.run()` --
  matching how Crow's own default handler is also a function-local static internally). This replaces
  Crow's default `CerrLogHandler` (plain-text lines to stderr) globally, so every log call Crow already
  makes internally -- server startup, per-request Info-level request/response lines, warnings/errors --
  becomes structured JSON on stdout with zero new call sites needed anywhere else in the app.
- The one manual `std::cout <<` startup banner line in `HttpServer.cpp` was switched to `CROW_LOG_INFO`
  so it also flows through the same handler instead of bypassing it as raw unstructured text.
- New source file added to the `ticket-hub` server target only in `CMakeLists.txt` (it depends on
  `crow.h`, same as `RateLimiter`/`Api`/`HttpServer`).

### What changed -- admin version banner (D112)

- D112's V1 answer: "Simple in-app admin banner when a newer version is available; no email delivery."
  No decision text (or any other document in this repository) specifies *how* the app would discover the
  latest available version -- there is no outbound-HTTP-client library linked anywhere in this codebase,
  and no URL/manifest/release-feed is named. Building an actual "check GitHub releases" (or similar)
  mechanism would be genuinely new capability, not implementing an already-decided detail. The
  conservative, explicitly documented choice: a global-administrator-only setting the admin fills in
  themselves (e.g. after checking a release page), compared against the running build's own
  `TICKETHUB_VERSION`. No outbound network calls, consistent with the rest of V1's offline-friendly
  self-hosted posture.
- New `TicketService::latestKnownVersion(actor)`/`setLatestKnownVersion(version, actor)`, both
  `requireGlobalAdmin`-gated (unlike the anonymous-read-access toggle, whose *read* is available to any
  session -- here, only an admin ever acts on this value, so there is no reason for a non-admin to see
  it). Reuses the existing generic `installation_settings` key/value table via `getSetting`/`setSetting`
  (no new migration -- `latest_known_version` is just a new key in an already-existing table) and the
  existing `recordAuditEvent` call, exactly mirroring the anonymous-read-access toggle's implementation
  pattern.
- New `GET`/`PUT /api/v1/settings/latest-known-version` routes in `Api.cpp`, structurally identical to
  the existing `GET`/`PUT /api/v1/settings/anonymous-read` routes (CSRF/rate-limit/body-size checks on
  the write side, `Domain::Forbidden` → 403 mapping). `GET` returns `{currentVersion, latestKnownVersion,
  updateAvailable}` -- `updateAvailable` is a simple string-inequality comparison against the setting
  when present, `false` when the setting has never been set. `PUT` rejects an empty/missing `version`
  with `400`.
- `web/index.html` gained a `#update-banner` element (hidden by default) between the topbar and the main
  content area. `web/app.js`'s `loadBaseData()` (called on every page load and after login) now also
  calls a new `refreshUpdateBanner()`: skips entirely for a non-admin (`state.principal.isAdmin` false,
  matching the route's own 403 rather than surfacing an error toast for something a non-admin can't act
  on anyway), otherwise fetches the endpoint and shows/hides the banner based on `updateAvailable`.

### Verification

1. `cmake --build` (full config, `-DTICKETHUB_BUILD_SERVER=ON`): zero warnings/errors from Ticket Hub's
   own files.
2. `ctest --output-on-failure`: 8/8 green -- unchanged; both features are HTTP/logging-layer additions
   with no domain/database behavior change to any existing tested path (the `installation_settings` key
   reuses already-tested generic `getSetting`/`setSetting` methods).
3. Re-ran the SQLite-only and PostgreSQL-only build configurations: both compile cleanly and pass their
   respective test suites (8/8 and 4/4). `JsonLogHandler.cpp` is server-target-only (not part of
   `ticket-hub-core`), so it is not compiled in either config, matching `RateLimiter`'s precedent.
4. No live-PostgreSQL check for this batch specifically: the version-banner feature reuses the already
   live-PostgreSQL-verified generic `getSetting`/`setSetting` code path (previously exercised by the
   anonymous-read-access toggle in an earlier phase) with no new SQL in either adapter; the JSON-log
   change has no database dimension at all.
5. End-to-end HTTP verification via `curl` against a locally running server (SQLite, demo-seeded):
   - Piped real request traffic (`/api/health`, a failed login) through the running server and confirmed
     every stdout line parses as valid JSON (Python's `json.loads`) with the four expected fields present.
   - `GET /api/v1/settings/latest-known-version` before ever setting it: `latestKnownVersion: null`,
     `updateAvailable: false`.
   - `PUT` with the same version as `TICKETHUB_VERSION`: `updateAvailable` stays `false`. `PUT` with a
     different (higher) version string: `updateAvailable` becomes `true`.
   - `PUT` with an empty `version`: `400`.
   - The same `GET` as a non-admin (`sam`): `403`.
6. Browser verification via Playwright/Chromium: logged in as the admin (`demo`) after setting
   `latest_known_version` to `0.3.0` via `curl`, confirmed the banner is visible with the exact expected
   text (`"A newer Ticket Hub version is available: 0.3.0 (currently running 0.2.0)..."`); logged in as
   the non-admin (`sam`) against the same server state and confirmed the banner is not visible at all.
   Also re-ran the existing `project_management_test.mjs` regression script (unrelated flow, exercising a
   different part of `loadBaseData()`'s callers) to confirm no unrelated regression from touching
   `loadBaseData()`.

## 2026-08-02 — Backup and restore (D106-D108): Phase 7 slice 1

First Phase 7 slice, directly following the close of Phase 6. Still open in Phase 7: the in-app admin
banner for available updates (D112) and structured JSON logs to stdout (D133). D111 (upgrades) required
no new work -- `ticket-hub-cli migrate` already fully satisfies it.

### What changed

- New `IDatabase::backup(directory)`/`restore(directory)` (pure virtual, implemented in both adapters):
  scoped to the database only -- the CLI commands separately handle copying the attachments directory,
  since that is not a database concern.
- **SqliteDatabase**: uses the SQLite online backup API (`sqlite3_backup_init`/`sqlite3_backup_step`/
  `sqlite3_backup_finish`) rather than a raw file copy. The database runs in WAL mode
  (`PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL`, set in the constructor); a plain `cp`/`std::filesystem::copy_file` of
  only the main `.sqlite3` file could silently miss data still sitting in an unmerged `-wal` file. The
  backup API produces a correct, complete snapshot regardless of WAL/checkpoint state. `restore` runs the
  same API in reverse: the backup file (opened read-only) is the *source*, and the currently-open
  `database_` connection is the *destination*, so restoring replaces the live database's content in
  place through the same handle every other method already uses.
- **PostgresDatabase**: shells out to the `pg_dump`/`psql` client binaries (both standard PostgreSQL
  tools, not reimplemented over libpq -- re-deriving dump/restore logic would be substantial, fragile
  duplication for no benefit). `backup` runs `pg_dump --clean --if-exists <conninfo> -f
  <directory>/database.sql` -- `--clean --if-exists` makes the dump self-contained for a *direct* restore
  (D108: no isolated staging environment): replaying it against a non-empty target works, since the dump
  itself drops each object (if it exists) before recreating it. `restore` runs
  `psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 <conninfo> -f <directory>/database.sql` -- `ON_ERROR_STOP=1` makes psql abort
  (non-zero exit, caught and turned into a thrown exception) on the first SQL error instead of continuing
  and reporting overall success on a partially-failed restore. A local `shellQuote` helper single-quotes
  the connection string and file paths before interpolating them into the shell command string; both are
  admin-controlled (from `TICKETHUB_DATABASE_URL` and a CLI argument), not untrusted network input, but
  quoting is applied regardless for correctness against paths/values containing shell metacharacters or
  spaces.
- New `ticket-hub-cli backup <output-directory>`: copies `config.attachmentsRoot` into
  `<output-directory>/attachments` (if it exists), then calls `database->backup(...)`. Refuses to write
  into a directory that already exists and is non-empty (a cheap guard against accidentally clobbering an
  existing backup or writing into an unrelated populated directory).
- New `ticket-hub-cli restore <backup-directory> --yes`: requires the literal `--yes` flag; without it,
  prints a clear warning naming the backup directory and exits `2` without touching anything. With
  `--yes`: calls `database->restore(...)`, then `database->migrate()` as an explicit, separate, visible
  step (D109: "forward migrate older supported backups" -- so a backup taken on an older schema version
  is brought current automatically as part of restoring it), then copies `<backup-directory>/attachments`
  back over `config.attachmentsRoot` (creating it if needed, overwriting existing files).
- New CLI usage text for both commands in `printUsage`.

### Verification

1. `cmake --build` (full config, `-DTICKETHUB_BUILD_SERVER=ON`): zero warnings/errors from Ticket Hub's
   own files.
2. `ctest --output-on-failure`: 8/8 green, including new `ticket-hub-sqlite-integration-tests` coverage:
   `backup` writes a non-empty `database.sqlite3` into the output directory; a database mutated (one more
   issue created) *after* the backup was taken is reverted by `restore` back to exactly the 8-issue state
   the backup captured, and the post-backup issue does not survive the restore.
3. Re-ran the SQLite-only and PostgreSQL-only build configurations: both compile cleanly and pass their
   respective test suites (8/8 and 4/4).
4. **Live PostgreSQL, full exit-gate cycle**: found the same local PostgreSQL 16 cluster used in the
   pagination batch (`pg_lsclusters`/`service postgresql start`), created a throwaway database/role, and
   ran the exact scripted cycle Phase 7's exit gate describes:
   - `ticket-hub-cli seed-demo` (fresh install → seed).
   - Added a marker file to the attachments directory.
   - `ticket-hub-cli backup <dir>`: confirmed `<dir>/database.sql` contains `COPY` blocks with the
     expected row counts (8 issues, etc. -- `pg_dump`'s default plain-text format uses `COPY`, not
     `INSERT`, for bulk data) and `<dir>/attachments/` contains the marker file.
   - Destroyed the live database (`DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE; CREATE SCHEMA public;`) and deleted the
     attachments directory, simulating total data loss.
   - `ticket-hub-cli restore <dir>` **without** `--yes`: confirmed it printed the warning and exited `2`
     without touching anything.
   - `ticket-hub-cli restore <dir> --yes`: confirmed it succeeded (`psql`'s `COPY N` lines matched the
     original row counts exactly) and ran migrations afterward with no errors.
   - Confirmed via `psql`: issue count back to `8`, both project keys (`TH`, `WEB`) present.
   - Confirmed the marker attachment file's exact byte content survived the round trip.
   - Dropped the throwaway database/role afterward.
5. **SQLite, the same exit-gate cycle**, independently via the CLI (not just the integration-test API
   calls in step 2): seeded a fresh SQLite file, added a marker attachment file, backed up, deleted the
   database file (plus `-wal`/`-shm`) and the attachments directory entirely, confirmed restore without
   `--yes` refuses, then restored with `--yes` and confirmed (via Python's `sqlite3` module, since the
   `sqlite3` CLI binary is not installed in this environment) the issue count, project keys, and the
   marker attachment file's content all matched exactly.

## 2026-08-02 — Numbered/offset pagination for issues (D126): Phase 6 slice 8, Phase 6 complete

Eighth and final Phase 6 slice. Every item in `docs/REDUCED_SCOPE_ROADMAP.md`'s Phase 6 list is now
implemented: `/api/v1` REST surface (D127), PAT authentication (D39/D40), fixed rate limits including the
account-lockout policy (D124/D125), fixed request/batch-size constants (D125), the active-session list
(D54), read-only CSV export (D48), the security hardening pass, and now numbered/offset pagination
(D126). **This closes Phase 6 and its exit gate.** Note: this is a deliberate *partial* rollout of D126 --
only `GET /api/v1/issues` is paginated. Every other list endpoint (projects, comments, worklogs,
attachments, notifications, sessions, tokens, audit events, watchers, voters, board-columns, issue-links,
comment-reactions) remains unpaginated, documented explicitly as still open rather than silently
incomplete.

### What changed

- **Bug found while implementing this**: `SqliteDatabase::listIssues`/`PostgresDatabase::listIssues` had
  always had a hardcoded `LIMIT 200` in their SQL, with no `total` count returned anywhere and no
  documentation of the cap -- a caller with more than 200 matching issues silently got a truncated result
  set with no way to detect it. This predates this session; it was introduced in the original prototype
  and never revisited. Fixed as part of this batch (see below), not filed as a separate bug, since the
  fix *is* the pagination feature.
- New `Domain::Page<T>` template (`src/domain/Models.h`): `items`, `page`, `pageSize`, `totalItems`, and
  a computed `totalPages()`. New fixed constants `Domain::DefaultPageSize`/`Domain::MaxPageSize` (both
  200 -- deliberately equal, and deliberately matching the pre-existing 200-row cap, so a caller that
  never sends `page`/`pageSize` gets *exactly* the same result set it always got; pagination is additive
  for every existing caller, not a behavior change). This also gives concrete meaning to D125's
  previously-undefined "max page size," which had been blocked on D126 not existing yet.
- New `IDatabase::listIssues(filter, limit, offset)` and `IDatabase::countIssues(filter)` in both
  `SqliteDatabase` and `PostgresDatabase`, implemented as new methods alongside (not replacing) the
  existing unpaginated `listIssues(filter)` overload, which is still used internally
  (`TicketService`'s "assigned to me" dashboard fetch, both adapters' own "recent issues" fetch) and by
  the CSV export route (D48), which deliberately wants *everything* matching the filter, not one page of
  it. `countIssues` uses a leaner query (no label-aggregation `LEFT JOIN`/`GROUP BY`, just an `EXISTS`
  subquery for the label filter, matching how the label filter is already checked in the row-fetching
  query) to avoid the row-multiplication that the full `IssueSelect` view's label join would otherwise
  cause in a naive `COUNT(*)`.
- New `TicketService::listIssuesPaged(filter, page, pageSize, actor)`: clamps `page` to at least 1 and
  `pageSize` into `[1, MaxPageSize]` (fixed constants, no admin exceptions, per D125), computes the
  offset, and pairs one `countIssues` call with one paginated `listIssues` call.
- `GET /api/v1/issues` now calls `listIssuesPaged` instead of the unpaginated `listIssues`; new optional
  `page`/`pageSize` query parameters (new `optionalIntQueryParameter` helper, throwing `std::invalid_argument`
  -- mapped to `400` -- for a non-numeric value rather than silently ignoring it); the response envelope
  gains `page`/`pageSize`/`totalItems`/`totalPages` fields alongside the existing `items` array.
- New SQLite-integration test coverage: `countIssues` matches the unpaginated `listIssues` row count for
  the same filter; a 3-item page and a second 3-item page don't overlap and together advance past the
  first page; an offset beyond the total row count returns an empty page rather than erroring; a limit
  exceeding the total returns every matching row rather than erroring; pagination composes correctly with
  an existing filter (every row in a filtered+paginated page still matches the filter).

### Verification

1. `cmake --build` (full config, `-DTICKETHUB_BUILD_SERVER=ON`): zero warnings/errors from Ticket Hub's
   own files.
2. `ctest --output-on-failure`: 8/8 green, including the new pagination assertions in
   `ticket-hub-sqlite-integration-tests`.
3. Re-ran the SQLite-only and PostgreSQL-only build configurations (`-DTICKETHUB_BUILD_SERVER=OFF` in
   both): both compile cleanly and pass their respective test suites (8/8 and 4/4).
4. **Live PostgreSQL verification** (this batch's database-layer changes warranted it, unlike several
   recent Phase 6 batches that made no `IDatabase` changes): found a local PostgreSQL 16 cluster already
   present in this environment (`pg_lsclusters`), started it (`service postgresql start`), created a
   throwaway role/database, ran the full server against it with auto-migrate/seed-demo, and repeated
   every `curl` check below against it -- identical results to SQLite on every check. Dropped the
   throwaway database/role afterward.
5. End-to-end HTTP verification via `curl` against locally running servers (both SQLite and, per above,
   live PostgreSQL, demo-seeded):
   - No `page`/`pageSize`: `page=1`, `pageSize=200`, `totalItems=8`, `totalPages=1`, all 8 seeded issues
     returned -- confirming the exact same result set as before this batch.
   - `pageSize=3&page=1` then `pageSize=3&page=2`: six distinct, non-overlapping issue keys across the
     two pages, in stable order.
   - `pageSize=300` (exceeds `MaxPageSize`): clamped to `pageSize: 200` in the response, not rejected.
   - `page=abc` (non-numeric): `400`.
   - `project=TH&pageSize=2&page=2`: `totalItems` reflects only the `TH` project's issue count, and the
     returned page contains only `TH-*` issues -- filtering and pagination compose correctly.
   - `GET /api/v1/issues/export.csv` and `GET /api/v1/dashboard`: unaffected, confirming the unpaginated
     `listIssues(filter)` overload and its callers are untouched by this batch.
6. Browser regression: re-ran the existing `reorder_move_bulk_test.mjs` and `login_browser_test.mjs`
   Playwright scripts (the demo UI's heaviest consumers of `GET /api/v1/issues`) against the running
   server; all assertions passed unchanged, confirming the additive response-envelope change (new fields
   alongside the existing `items` array) does not break the UI's existing `result.items` consumption.

## 2026-08-02 — Security hardening pass: Phase 6 slice 7

Seventh Phase 6 slice, directly following the fixed request/batch-size constants batch. This is the
roadmap's "security hardening pass: dependency review, header review, session/CSRF review against
`handoff/KNOWN_CONSTRAINTS_AND_RISKS.md`" item. **Note:** `handoff/KNOWN_CONSTRAINTS_AND_RISKS.md` does
not exist anywhere in this repository -- only `docs/HANDOFF_NOTES.md` (a general onboarding doc, not a
risk register) exists. The review below was performed as a direct code-level audit instead of against
that (missing) file. With this batch done, Phase 6's only remaining item is numbered/offset pagination
(D126).

### What changed -- a real vulnerability found and fixed

While reviewing response headers, found that `GET /api/v1/attachments/{id}/download` always served
`Content-Disposition: inline`, and that an attachment's `contentType` is entirely caller-supplied and
unvalidated (D98 deliberately has no upload-time MIME allow-list, and the blocked-extension list only
blocks executable-ish extensions like `.exe`/`.bat`, not `.txt`/other safe-looking names). Concretely: any
project member could upload a file named e.g. `notes.txt` with its multipart `Content-Type` part spoofed
to `text/html` and a `<script>` payload as the body. Two exploitable paths followed from this:

1. **Direct download-URL navigation**: `Content-Disposition: inline` + `Content-Type: text/html` means a
   browser navigating straight to the download URL renders the attacker's HTML as a same-origin document,
   executing the embedded script with access to the app's origin (including the readable, non-HttpOnly
   `th_csrf` cookie -- enough to forge CSRF-protected write requests).
2. **The app's own "text" preview**: `attachmentPreviewKind` classifies anything with a `text/*`
   content-type (which includes a spoofed `text/html`) as `'text'`, and the issue drawer rendered that
   preview inside an `<iframe src="...">` with **no `sandbox` attribute** -- so even a user who never
   directly visits the download URL, but simply clicks "preview" on the malicious attachment inside the
   app's own UI, would trigger same-origin script execution.

This is a real stored-XSS / CSRF-bypass chain reachable by any project member against any other user
(including a global administrator) who previews or opens the malicious attachment -- a genuine privilege-
escalation path, not a theoretical one. Fixed with two independent, complementary layers:

- **`web/app.js`**: both the PDF and text `<iframe>` previews now carry `sandbox=""` (no flags at all --
  disables script execution, plugins, forms, and top-level navigation from inside the iframe
  unconditionally, regardless of what content-type/disposition the server ever serves). This is the
  load-bearing fix, since it closes the vulnerability regardless of any Content-Disposition subtlety.
- **`src/web/Api.cpp`**: new `contentTypeSafeToRenderInline(contentType)` — an explicit deny-list of
  document/script-capable MIME prefixes (`text/html`, `application/xhtml*`, `image/svg*`,
  `application/xml`, `text/xml`, `application/xslt`, `application/javascript`, `text/javascript`,
  `application/ecmascript`). The download route now serves `Content-Disposition: attachment` (forced
  download, never rendered as a document) for anything matching that deny-list, and `inline` (unchanged
  behavior) for everything else -- closing the direct-URL-navigation path independently of the iframe fix.
  `<img>`/`<audio>`/`<video>` tag rendering is unaffected either way, since those elements do not honor
  `Content-Disposition` (confirmed: a real PNG upload still serves `inline` and previews via `<img>`
  exactly as before).

### What changed -- standard security headers

- New `applySecurityHeaders(response)` in `Api.cpp`, called from every response-construction chokepoint
  (`jsonResponse`, and the two routes that build a `crow::response` directly -- the CSV export and the
  attachment download): `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`,
  `Referrer-Policy: same-origin`.
- New `applyStaticSecurityHeaders(response)` in `HttpServer.cpp`, applied to every static asset response
  (`/`, `/app.js`, `/styles.css`, `/favicon.svg`): the same three headers.
- New `applyHtmlSecurityHeaders(response)`, applied only to `/` (the HTML document itself, the only
  response type where a CSP is meaningful): adds
  `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
  img-src 'self' data:; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'; form-action 'self'`.
  `script-src 'self'` is the load-bearing clause -- it blocks any injected/inline `<script>` from
  executing at all, a second layer of defense behind the app's own Markdown-HTML sanitization and the
  now-sandboxed attachment-preview iframes. `style-src` allows `'unsafe-inline'` deliberately: `web/app.js`
  renders many inline `style="..."` attributes for layout (not user-controlled content), and reworking
  that to CSS classes is out of scope for this pass -- inline styles cannot execute script, so this is a
  low-risk, explicit exception, not an oversight.

### Dependency review

Crow (the only fetched third-party dependency, via `FetchContent`) is pinned to release tag `v1.3.3`, not
a floating branch -- already good practice, no change needed. SQLite3/PostgreSQL/Argon2 are resolved via
`find_package` against system-installed libraries, not vendored/fetched, so there is no supply-chain
pinning concern to add there either. No dependency changes in this batch.

### Session/CSRF review

Re-confirmed (unchanged from prior batches, no regressions introduced by the PAT/rate-limiting/versioning
work earlier this session): the session cookie is `HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict`; the CSRF cookie is
`Secure; SameSite=Strict` (deliberately not `HttpOnly`, since client-side JS must read it to echo as the
`X-CSRF-Token` header); `csrfTokenValid` still correctly requires an exact cookie/header match and is
still correctly exempted only when no session cookie is present at all (PAT/Bearer-authenticated
requests). No changes needed here; already matches CLAUDE.md's security rules.

### Verification

1. `cmake --build` (full config, `-DTICKETHUB_BUILD_SERVER=ON`): zero warnings/errors from Ticket Hub's
   own files.
2. `ctest --output-on-failure`: 8/8 green -- this batch is header/response-shape changes plus one
   deny-list function with no domain/database surface, so the existing suite (which never asserts on
   response headers) is unaffected and still exercises every write-path behavior unchanged.
3. No live-PostgreSQL check: no database or `IDatabase` changes in this batch.
4. End-to-end HTTP verification via `curl` against a locally running server (SQLite, demo-seeded):
   - Confirmed `X-Content-Type-Options`/`X-Frame-Options`/`Referrer-Policy` present on `/`, `/app.js`, and
     `/api/health` responses; confirmed `Content-Security-Policy` present only on `/`.
   - Uploaded a file named `evil.txt` with a spoofed `Content-Type: text/html` multipart part; confirmed
     the download response now serves `Content-Disposition: attachment` (previously `inline`).
   - Uploaded a real PNG with `Content-Type: image/png`; confirmed the download response still serves
     `Content-Disposition: inline` exactly as before (no regression for legitimate image previews).
5. Browser verification via Playwright/Chromium:
   - Re-ran the existing attachment-preview-kinds test (PDF/text/audio/video) against the sandboxed
     iframes: all four preview kinds still render their expected tag (`<iframe>` for pdf/text,
     `<audio>`/`<video>` for the others) exactly as before -- confirming `sandbox=""` does not break the
     legitimate preview functionality.
   - New targeted XSS-reproduction test: uploaded a `text/html`-spoofed `evil.txt` containing
     `<script>alert("XSS-MARKER: " + document.cookie)</script>`, clicked its preview in the issue drawer
     (the exact vulnerable path found above), and confirmed **no `dialog` event fired** (Playwright's
     `page.on('dialog')` would catch an `alert()` call) -- the payload did not execute. Before the
     `sandbox=""` fix this same script would have fired the dialog; this test is the regression guard
     against the fix being accidentally reverted.

## 2026-08-02 — Fixed request/batch-size constants (D125): Phase 6 slice 6

Sixth Phase 6 slice, directly following the CSV export batch. Still open: numbered pagination (D126,
which max page size from D125 is coupled to and remains blocked on) and the security hardening pass.

### What changed

- New `MaxJsonRequestBodyBytes` (1 MiB) constant in `Api.cpp`, enforced via a scripted substitution at
  all 20 `const auto body = crow::json::load(request.body);` call sites (a single exact-text pattern,
  confirmed identical via the same kind of pre-edit regex scan used for the CSRF/rate-limit chokepoints
  in earlier batches): a `request.body.size() > MaxJsonRequestBodyBytes` check immediately precedes the
  parse, returning `413 Payload Too Large` before any JSON parsing happens. Enforced against the already-
  buffered `request.body.size()`, not against the `Content-Length` header pre-buffer -- Crow's SimpleApp
  has no built-in hook for the latter, so this caps what the application processes rather than what the
  socket layer buffers. Documented as a known, honest limitation: a real internet-facing deployment
  should also enforce a body-size limit at a reverse proxy in front of this server. The multipart
  attachment upload route is untouched -- it already enforces its own stricter, purpose-built 25MB/file
  limit (D98) via `Domain::validateAttachmentUpload`, unrelated to this constant.
- New `MaxBulkItems` (200) constant, enforced in the single shared `requiredIssueKeys(body)` helper that
  all four `POST /api/v1/issues/bulk/*` routes already called -- one chokepoint, no route-by-route
  changes needed. Throws `std::invalid_argument` (mapped to the existing `400` handler in all four
  routes) when `issueKeys.size() > MaxBulkItems`.
- Max page size intentionally not implemented: it has no meaning until numbered/offset pagination (D126)
  exists, and faking a page-size cap on today's fully-unpaginated list endpoints would not match D125's
  intent. Documented in-source and here rather than silently skipped.
- No admin configuration for either enforced limit, matching D125's "no admin exceptions."
- No database/migration changes.

### Verification

1. `cmake --build` (full config, `-DTICKETHUB_BUILD_SERVER=ON`): zero warnings/errors from Ticket Hub's
   own files.
2. `ctest --output-on-failure`: 8/8 green -- unchanged; this batch adds size checks ahead of existing
   logic and does not change behavior for any request within the limits, which is what every existing
   test exercises.
3. No live-PostgreSQL check: no database or `IDatabase` changes in this batch.
4. End-to-end HTTP verification via `curl` against a locally running server (SQLite, demo-seeded):
   - A ~1.05MB JSON issue-creation body returned `413` with body `{"error":"Request body too large"}`.
   - A bulk-label request with 201 `issueKeys` returned `400` with body
     `{"error":"issueKeys must not contain more than 200 items"}`; the same request with exactly 200
     `issueKeys` returned `200` (confirming the boundary is `> 200`, not `>= 200`).
   - A normal-sized issue-creation request (well under 1 MiB) still returned `201` as before, confirming
     no regression for ordinary traffic.
5. Browser regression: re-ran the existing `reorder_move_bulk_test.mjs` Playwright script (reorder,
   move-to-another-project, and bulk actions -- the write paths most directly touched by this batch,
   since bulk actions now flow through the new `MaxBulkItems` check) against the running server; all
   assertions passed unchanged, confirming ordinary-sized traffic through the newly-touched call sites is
   unaffected.

## 2026-08-02 — Read-only CSV export of issues (D48): Phase 6 slice 5

Fifth Phase 6 slice, directly following the `/api/v1` versioning batch. Still open: fixed request/body/
batch-size constants, numbered pagination, and the security hardening pass.

### What changed

- New `GET /api/v1/issues/export.csv` route in `Api.cpp`. Shares `Domain::IssueFilter`'s query-parameter
  parsing with the existing `GET /api/v1/issues` JSON list route via a new `issueFilterFromQuery(request)`
  helper (factored out of both routes) and the same `resolvePrincipal`-based authorization -- an export is
  always scoped to whatever the caller could already see via the list view. No CSRF/rate-limit check,
  matching every other read-only GET route.
- New `csvField(value)` helper (RFC 4180-style: quote-wraps a field containing a comma, quote, or
  newline, doubling internal quotes) and `issuesToCsv(issues)` (builds the full CSV body, `\r\n` line
  endings). Columns: key, project, summary, description, type, status, priority, reporter, assignee,
  storyPoints, dueDate, resolution, labels (semicolon-joined within the field, itself still subject to
  `csvField` escaping), createdAt, updatedAt.
- Route ordering: `/api/v1/issues/export.csv` sits at the same path depth as the parameterized
  `/api/v1/issues/{key}` route. Confirmed via `curl` that Crow's trie router resolves the static segment
  first (matching the existing precedent of `/api/v1/issues/deleted` and `/api/v1/issues/bulk/*`
  coexisting with `/api/v1/issues/{key}` without incident).
- `web/app.js`: factored the existing ad-hoc `fetchIssues()` query-building into a reusable
  `issueFilterParams()` function, then used it to build the `href` of a new "Export CSV" link
  (`<a class="secondary-button" download="issues.csv">`) placed in the Issues view's page-actions row,
  next to the recycle-bin toggle. Hidden in the recycle-bin view (nothing meaningful to export there).
  Re-rendered on every filter change, so the link's `href` always matches the currently visible/filtered
  issue set. New `a.secondary-button` CSS rule (`display: inline-block; text-decoration: none; cursor:
  pointer;`) since this class had only ever been applied to `<button>` elements before.
- No database/migration changes, no new domain/application code -- purely an `Api.cpp` route plus a thin
  `web/` affordance.

### Verification

1. `cmake --build` (full config, `-DTICKETHUB_BUILD_SERVER=ON`): zero warnings/errors from Ticket Hub's
   own files.
2. `ctest --output-on-failure`: 8/8 green -- unchanged, since `csvField`/`issuesToCsv`/the new route are
   pure `Api.cpp`/HTTP-layer code with no domain/application/database surface to unit-test against,
   verified instead via `curl` and a real browser download, matching how this project has verified other
   Api.cpp-only route additions (e.g. the PAT Bearer-auth exemption).
3. No live-PostgreSQL check: no database or `IDatabase` changes in this batch.
4. End-to-end HTTP verification via `curl` against a locally running server (SQLite, demo-seeded):
   confirmed `Content-Type: text/csv; charset=utf-8` and `Content-Disposition: attachment;
   filename="issues.csv"` headers; confirmed the CSV body lists every seeded issue with correctly-quoted
   fields (a summary/description containing a literal comma round-tripped correctly, wrapped in quotes);
   confirmed `?project=WEB` scopes the export to only that project's two seeded issues; confirmed an
   unauthenticated request (anonymous read disabled, the default) returns `401`; confirmed
   `GET /api/v1/issues/TH-1` (the parameterized `{key}` route) and the plain `GET /api/v1/issues` list
   route both still resolve correctly alongside the new static `export.csv` route.
5. Browser verification via Playwright/Chromium: logged in, navigated to the Issues view, captured the
   real browser-initiated download (`page.waitForEvent('download')`, not just an HTTP assertion) from
   clicking the new "Export CSV" link, confirmed the suggested filename (`issues.csv`) and row count
   matched the seeded data; filtered by `project=WEB` in the UI, confirmed the link's `href` updated to
   include `project=WEB`, re-downloaded, and confirmed every row in the new file starts with `WEB-`.

## 2026-08-02 — Versioned `/api/v1` prefix (D127): Phase 6 slice 4

Fourth Phase 6 slice, directly following the rate-limiting batch. Still open: fixed request/body/batch-
size constants, numbered pagination, CSV export, and the security hardening pass.

### What changed

- Every `CROW_ROUTE(app, "/api/...")` registration in `Api.cpp` (70 total) moved to `/api/v1/...`, via a
  single scripted regex substitution, except `GET /api/health`, deliberately kept unversioned --
  following the common convention that infra/monitoring health checks live outside API versioning. Not
  specified by any decision text; a conservative choice documented here explicitly. A handful of
  in-source comments referencing exact routes were updated to match.
- `web/app.js`'s ~63 API call sites (there is no single base-URL constant -- every call site hardcodes its
  own `/api/...` path string, including inside template literals) were updated the same way, via a
  matching scripted regex substitution over the whole file, again sparing `/api/health`.
- No server/domain/database logic changed anywhere -- this batch is a pure URL rename with zero behavior
  change beyond the URL itself.
- Documentation: updated the *living* current-state references (`README.md`'s API section/route table,
  `docs/SCOPE.md`, `docs/SCHEMA.md`, `PLAN.md`) to the new `/api/v1/...` paths. Deliberately did **not**
  rewrite the dated, historical batch narratives in this file or in `CHANGELOG.md`/`NEXT.md`'s
  per-batch bullets -- those describe what was literally true at the time each entry was written (under
  whichever prefix was live then), matching this project's existing convention of never retroactively
  editing past dated log entries.

### Verification

1. `cmake --build` (full config, `-DTICKETHUB_BUILD_SERVER=ON`): zero warnings/errors from Ticket Hub's
   own files.
2. `ctest --output-on-failure`: 8/8 green -- this batch touched no test-relevant logic (the existing
   integration tests call `TicketService`/`AuthService` directly, never over HTTP, so none of them
   reference a literal `/api/...` path).
3. No live-PostgreSQL check: this batch made no database or `IDatabase` changes, and HTTP routing is
   identical regardless of backend, so there is nothing backend-specific to verify against a live server.
4. End-to-end HTTP verification via `curl` against a locally running server (SQLite, demo-seeded):
   `GET /api/health` still returns `200` unversioned; the old unversioned `GET /api/projects` now returns
   `404`; `POST /api/v1/auth/login` and an authenticated `GET /api/v1/projects` both work exactly as the
   unversioned routes did before.
5. Full browser regression pass with the existing Playwright/Chromium suite (unmodified from prior
   batches, run against the renamed routes to confirm `web/app.js` has no remaining hardcoded old-prefix
   paths): login/logout; full project lifecycle (create, duplicate-key rejection, archive, delete,
   recycle-bin restore/permanent-delete, non-admin 403 on create); issue watch/vote toggling, cloning,
   issue links (add/click-navigate/delete), full-replacement edit with save/cancel; manual reorder
   (move-up/move-down with correct renumbering), move-to-another-project, and bulk actions (multi-select,
   bulk label with a toast reporting succeeded/failed counts). All green, confirming the UI has zero
   remaining references to the unversioned prefix.

## 2026-08-02 — Fixed rate limits (D124/D125): Phase 6 slice 3

Third Phase 6 slice, directly following the active-session-list batch. Still open: the versioned
`/api/v1` prefix, fixed request/body/batch-size constants, numbered pagination, CSV export, and the
security hardening pass.

### What changed

- New `TicketHub::Web::RateLimiter` (`src/web/RateLimiter.h/.cpp`): a thread-safe, in-memory, fixed-window
  counter keyed by an arbitrary string, with lazy periodic sweeping of expired buckets (every 512 calls)
  so the map does not grow unbounded over a long-running process. Two hardcoded instances, matching D124's
  "simple fixed rate limit per IP/user ... no admin config, no per-endpoint/service-account exceptions"
  exactly:
  - `loginRateLimiter()`: 20 attempts per IP (`remote_ip_address`) per 15 minutes, checked at the top of
    `POST /api/auth/login` before the request body is even parsed.
  - `writeRateLimiter()`: 120 requests per minute, keyed by `user:<id>` when `resolvePrincipal` resolves a
    caller, else `ip:<remote_ip_address>`.
- The write limiter deliberately reuses the same near-universal chokepoint as CSRF checking: all 43
  existing `if (!csrfTokenValid(request)) { ... }` blocks across `Api.cpp` are byte-identical (verified via
  a Python regex scan before editing), so a single scripted text substitution inserted a
  `writeRateLimitOk(request, principal)` check immediately after each one. The sole exception,
  `/api/sessions/sign-out-others`, resolves a `Domain::Session` (`current`) rather than a
  `Domain::Principal`, so it uses a dedicated `writeRateLimitOk(request, const std::string& userId)`
  overload instead.
- Deliberately does **not** touch the existing per-account login lockout
  (`recordFailedLogin`/`resetFailedLogin`/`isLoginLocked`, fixed 10-attempts/15-minutes, in both database
  adapters) -- the new IP-based limiter is an additional, complementary layer defending against
  distributed/enumeration attacks spread across many accounts from one source, not a replacement for the
  per-account lockout.
- `RateLimiter` is compiled into the `ticket-hub` server executable's own source list (not
  `ticket-hub-core`), since rate limiting is HTTP-layer-only and the CLI target has no use for it. It has
  no Crow dependency, so it is also compiled directly (with `src/web/RateLimiter.cpp`, no `ticket-hub-core`
  link) into a new standalone `ticket-hub-ratelimiter-tests` binary that builds unconditionally under
  `TICKETHUB_BUILD_TESTS`, independent of `TICKETHUB_BUILD_SERVER`.
- Both 429 responses carry a `Retry-After` header (900 seconds for the login limiter, 60 for the write
  limiter) via a small `rateLimitedResponse(message, retryAfterSeconds)` helper -- the original
  (pre-simplification) description of D124 paired 429 with Retry-After, and the V1 simplification text
  only drops the admin-configurable multi-level limits, not that response contract.
- No new migration; no `IDatabase` changes; no web UI changes (a 429 response surfaces through the
  existing generic API-error handling like any other error status).

### Verification

1. `cmake --build` (full config, `-DTICKETHUB_BUILD_SERVER=ON`): zero warnings/errors from Ticket Hub's
   own files.
2. `ctest --output-on-failure`: 8/8 green (the new eighth binary is `ticket-hub-ratelimiter-tests`: a
   fixed-window limit trips after N requests and rejects further ones within the same window; independent
   keys get independent buckets; the window rolls over and requests are allowed again after it expires).
3. Re-ran the SQLite-only and PostgreSQL-only build configurations (`-DTICKETHUB_BUILD_SERVER=OFF` in
   both): both compile cleanly, and `ticket-hub-ratelimiter-tests` builds and passes in both (8/8 and 4/4
   respectively, matching each configuration's existing test-binary count plus one) -- confirming
   `RateLimiter` really has no Crow/database dependency.
4. No live-PostgreSQL check: this batch made no database or `IDatabase` changes, so there is nothing
   backend-specific to verify against a live server.
5. End-to-end HTTP verification via `curl` against a locally running server (SQLite, demo-seeded):
   - Login limiter: 20 consecutive `POST /api/auth/login` requests with a wrong password all returned
     `401`; the 21st and 22nd returned `429` with body `{"error":"Too many login attempts. Try again
     later."}` and header `Retry-After: 900`.
   - Write limiter: after restarting the server (a fresh in-memory limiter) and logging in with the demo
     account, 130 consecutive `POST /api/projects` requests (valid session cookie + `X-CSRF-Token`) were
     issued back-to-back: the first 120 all returned non-429 status codes and the last 10 all returned
     `429` with body `{"error":"Too many requests. Try again later."}` and header `Retry-After: 60`.
   - Confirmed reads are unaffected: a `GET /api/projects` issued immediately after tripping the write
     limit still returned `200`, confirming the limiter only applies to write methods.
6. No browser/Playwright verification needed -- this batch touched no `web/` code, and there is no UI
   surface for a 429 beyond the existing generic fetch-error handling already exercised by prior batches.

## 2026-08-01 — Active-session list and "sign out everywhere" (D54): Phase 6 slice 2

Second Phase 6 slice, directly following the PAT batch. Still open: the versioned `/api/v1` prefix, rate
limits and the full lockout policy, CSV export, and the security hardening pass.

### What changed

- `IDatabase::listSessionsForUser(userId)` (every non-expired session, newest first) and
  `deleteOtherSessionsForUser(userId, keepSessionId)` (deletes every session for that user except
  `keepSessionId`, returns the count removed) in both adapters -- no new migration, `sessions` already had
  everything needed.
- `AuthService::currentSession(sessionToken)` resolves the session row itself (not just the `Principal`
  `validateSession` returns), so a caller can identify which entry in a session list is "this one."
  `listActiveSessions`/`signOutOtherSessions` are thin wrappers over the new `IDatabase` methods.
- **Conservative default, no decision text specifies this:** "sign out everywhere" keeps the caller's own
  current session active and only removes the others -- the request making the call should never lock its
  own caller out, matching the common GitHub/Google pattern. Documented here explicitly since the roadmap
  only says "active-session list and sign out everywhere endpoint" without this detail.
- New `GET /api/sessions` and `POST /api/sessions/sign-out-others` routes. Deliberately session-cookie-only
  (checked directly via the cookie, not through `resolvePrincipal`, which would also accept a PAT Bearer
  token): "your active web sessions" has no meaning for a PAT-authenticated caller, since a PAT is not a
  session at all.

### Verification

1. `cmake --build` (full config, `-DTICKETHUB_BUILD_SERVER=ON`): zero warnings/errors from Ticket Hub's
   own files.
2. `ctest --output-on-failure`: 7/7 green. New `identity_integration_tests` coverage: three concurrent
   sessions for one user all appear in `listActiveSessions`; `currentSession` resolves the right row (and
   is `nullopt` for an unknown token); `signOutOtherSessions` removes exactly the other two, the caller's
   own session survives (`validateSession` still succeeds on it), and the two removed sessions no longer
   validate.
3. Re-ran the SQLite-only and PostgreSQL-only build configurations: both compile cleanly.
4. Live PostgreSQL verification: a standalone smoke-test program (not committed) created three sessions
   directly, confirmed `listSessionsForUser` returns all three, confirmed `deleteOtherSessionsForUser`
   removes exactly two and returns `2`, and confirmed the kept session still resolves via
   `findSessionByTokenHash` while the removed two do not. All passed; database dropped afterward.
5. End-to-end HTTP verification via `curl` against a locally running server (SQLite, demo-seeded): logged
   in twice as `demo` (simulating two browser tabs) with two independent cookie jars; `GET /api/sessions`
   from tab A correctly listed both sessions with `isCurrent` set on the right one;
   `POST /api/sessions/sign-out-others` from tab A returned `{"signedOutCount":1}`; confirmed tab A's own
   session still authenticates (`200` on `/api/auth/me`) while tab B's now returns `401`; confirmed a
   follow-up `GET /api/sessions` from tab A shows only the one remaining (current) session.
6. A quick regression check (not the full suite, since nothing in `web/` changed and this batch is purely
   backend/API): re-ran the comment-editing and board-WIP-limits browser tests, both still passing
   unchanged, confirming ordinary cookie-based login and CSRF-protected writes were not affected by the
   `resolvePrincipal`/`csrfTokenValid` changes made in the prior PAT batch.

All checks passed. No committed test scripts (scratchpad only).

### What is still not built

Phase 6 (Milestone 3), continued: the versioned `/api/v1` prefix, fixed rate limits on login/write
endpoints and the full lockout policy (today's is still the minimal Phase 1 version), fixed
request/body/batch-size constants, numbered/offset pagination, read-only CSV export of issues, and the
security hardening pass. No web UI yet for viewing/signing-out sessions or managing tokens.

## 2026-08-01 — Personal access tokens (D39/D40): Phase 6 slice 1

First Phase 6 (Milestone 3) slice: PAT-only API authentication. The rest of Phase 6 (a versioned
`/api/v1` surface, fixed rate limits and the full lockout policy, active-session list, CSV export, and
the security hardening pass) is untouched.

### What changed

- Migration `015_personal_access_tokens.sql` (both backends) adds `personal_access_tokens`, mirroring
  `sessions` (`id`, `user_id`, `token_hash` unique, `created_at`, `expires_at`), plus `name` (a
  user-chosen label), `last_used_at` (nullable), and `revoked_at` (nullable -- a token can be revoked
  before it naturally expires). D40's "basic token security": hashed storage, expiration, revocation,
  last-used tracking; no scopes (a token carries exactly its owner's permissions), no rotation, no
  admin-configurable max lifetime.
- `Domain::PersonalAccessToken` (metadata only) and `Domain::CreatedPersonalAccessToken` (adds the raw
  token, returned only once, at creation, never stored or logged). `IDatabase::createPersonalAccessToken`/
  `findPersonalAccessTokenByHash`/`listPersonalAccessTokens`/`revokePersonalAccessToken`/
  `touchPersonalAccessTokenLastUsed` in both adapters -- `findPersonalAccessTokenByHash` mirrors
  `findSessionByTokenHash` exactly, filtering out expired/revoked tokens at the SQL layer so a present
  result always means "currently valid."
- `AuthService::createPersonalAccessToken` (requires a name and a positive `expiresInDays` -- D40 requires
  an expiration, there's no "never expires" option), `listPersonalAccessTokens`, `revokePersonalAccessToken`
  (ownership-scoped: only the owner can revoke their own token), `validatePersonalAccessToken` (mirrors
  `validateSession`, additionally touches `last_used_at` on success).
- `Api.cpp`'s `resolvePrincipal` now also checks an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header when no
  session cookie is present -- cookie and Bearer auth are mutually exclusive per request (D54: sessions
  for web, PATs for API). `csrfTokenValid` now returns `true` unconditionally when no session cookie is
  present: CSRF only defends against a browser silently attaching a cookie to a forged request, and a
  Bearer token is never auto-attached, so a PAT-authenticated write needs no CSRF header. This required no
  changes to any of the ~50 existing route handlers that already call `csrfTokenValid`. New self-service
  `GET`/`POST /api/tokens` and `DELETE /api/tokens/{id}` routes (session-cookie-authenticated, since
  managing your own tokens is a web-UI action even though the tokens themselves authenticate API calls).

### Verification

1. `cmake --build` (full config, `-DTICKETHUB_BUILD_SERVER=ON`): zero warnings/errors from Ticket Hub's
   own files.
2. `ctest --output-on-failure`: 7/7 green. New `identity_integration_tests` coverage: create/validate/
   list/revoke, last-used-at updates on validation, ownership enforcement (a non-owner's revoke attempt
   fails and the token survives), a revoked token no longer validates, and both `expiresInDays <= 0` and
   an empty name are rejected.
3. Re-ran the SQLite-only and PostgreSQL-only build configurations: both compile cleanly.
4. Live PostgreSQL verification: a standalone smoke-test program (not committed) exercised
   `PostgresDatabase`'s PAT methods directly -- create/find/touch-last-used/list/revoke, and confirmed
   both a revoked token and a separately created already-expired token both fail to resolve via
   `findPersonalAccessTokenByHash` while still appearing in `listPersonalAccessTokens` (so a user can see
   and manage tokens that have already lapsed). All passed; database dropped afterward.
5. End-to-end HTTP verification via `curl` against a locally running server (SQLite, demo-seeded, no
   Playwright for this slice since it has no web UI yet): created a token via cookie-authenticated
   `POST /api/tokens`; used the raw token as a Bearer header with **no cookies at all** to read
   `GET /api/auth/me` (resolved correctly) and to **write** via `POST /api/projects` with **no CSRF
   header** (succeeded, confirming the CSRF exemption works end-to-end through the real HTTP layer, not
   just in isolation); confirmed `GET /api/tokens` (cookie-authenticated) shows the updated `lastUsedAt`;
   revoked the token via `DELETE /api/tokens/{id}`; confirmed the same Bearer token now gets a 401.

All checks passed. No committed test scripts (scratchpad only).

### What is still not built

Phase 6 (Milestone 3) has just started. Still open: the versioned `/api/v1` surface itself (routes exist
today only under the unversioned `/api/*` prefix used by both the web UI and, as of this batch, PATs);
fixed rate limits on login/write endpoints and the full configurable-replacing lockout policy (today's
lockout is still the minimal Phase 1 version); the active-session list and "sign out everywhere" endpoint;
fixed request/body/batch-size constants and numbered/offset pagination; read-only CSV export of issues;
and the security hardening pass (dependency review, header review, session/CSRF review). There is also no
web UI yet for a user to create/view/revoke their own tokens -- `/api/tokens` is fully functional but only
reachable via `curl`/scripts today.

## 2026-08-01 — Attachments (D15/D98-D105): Phase 5 complete

Fourth and final Phase 5 slice. With this batch, every item in `docs/REDUCED_SCOPE_ROADMAP.md`'s Phase 5
list is implemented, closing out Milestone 2.

### What changed

- Migration `014_attachments.sql` (both backends) adds only an `idx_attachments_issue` index --
  `attachments.sha256`/`deleted_at`/`deleted_by_user_id` already existed from
  `003_product_foundation.sql`, pre-provisioned well ahead of this phase. An early draft of this
  migration re-added those three columns and failed on a live run with "duplicate column name: sha256";
  caught immediately by `ctest`, not shipped.
- `Domain::Attachment` (`id`, `issueId`, `issueKey` -- resolved via a join purely for the recycle bin's
  display convenience, `uploader`, `fileName`, `contentType`, `byteSize`, `sha256`, `createdAt`,
  `deletedAt` -- set only when returned from the recycle bin). `IDatabase::createAttachment` is the one
  create* method that takes a caller-supplied `id` rather than generating one internally: the local
  filesystem storage key (D15, hardwired, no storage-backend abstraction) must be known -- and the file
  already written -- before the row is inserted, so a database row never describes a file that doesn't
  exist on disk. `listAttachments`/`findAttachmentById`/`softDeleteAttachment`/`restoreAttachment`/
  `listDeletedAttachments`/`permanentlyDeleteAttachment` in both adapters, mirroring the
  issue/project/comment tombstone pattern. `listAttachmentStorageKeysForIssue`/`...ForProject` return
  every attachment's storage key regardless of soft-delete state -- used to delete files on disk before a
  permanent issue/project delete cascades through the database (there is no periodic orphan-file audit at
  all, D105, so this is the only cleanup path for files whose row is about to disappear via
  `ON DELETE CASCADE`).
- New `src/infrastructure/storage/LocalAttachmentStorage`: a plain, non-virtual class (D15 -- no abstract
  storage port/interface, so no S3-shaped extension point either), with `save`/`read`/`remove`/`sizeOf`
  against a flat directory, keyed by the attachment's own UUID. Defends against path traversal even
  though the key is always self-generated, never user input. Root directory is
  `TICKETHUB_ATTACHMENTS_DIR` (default `./data/attachments`, added to `.gitignore`).
- `Domain::validateAttachmentUpload` (D98): fixed 25MB/file, 20 attachments/issue, and a denylist of
  common executable/script extensions -- no admin configuration, no MIME allow-list, no quotas, no
  antivirus/DLP (all explicitly out of scope per D98's own "no admin configuration" answer).
- `TicketService`: `uploadAttachment` (project-Member-or-above, matching every other issue write) computes
  the SHA-256 at upload time (D105, never re-verified) and calls the storage class before the database
  insert. `downloadAttachment`/`listAttachments` mirror comments' read-access rule (any authenticated
  user, or anonymous if the installation toggle is on) -- no project-role check. `deleteAttachment` is
  uploader-or-project-Admin-or-above -- no decision text addresses attachment deletion directly, so this
  mirrors D83's comment edit/delete rule as the closest precedent. `listDeletedAttachments` implements
  D102's fixed 90-day on-demand retention itself (unlike `listDeletedIssues`/`listDeletedProjects`, which
  purge with a single `DELETE` entirely at the SQL layer): purging an attachment also means deleting its
  file on disk, which the SQL-only `IDatabase` layer cannot do, so the age check and the file removal both
  happen here, one layer up. `permanentlyDeleteIssue`/`permanentlyDeleteProject` were both extended to
  collect every affected attachment's storage key and delete its file *before* the database cascade runs.
- New routes: `GET`/`POST /api/issues/{key}/attachments` (list, and a `multipart/form-data` upload with a
  single `file` part), `DELETE /api/issues/{key}/attachments/{id}`,
  `GET /api/attachments/{id}/download` (not nested under `/issues/{key}` -- a download link, or an inline
  `<img>`/`<audio>`/`<video>`/`<iframe>` preview `src`, only ever needs the attachment id, since it can be
  referenced via `attachment://<id>` from any comment on the issue, not just its description),
  `GET /api/attachments/deleted`, `POST /api/attachments/{id}/restore`,
  `DELETE /api/attachments/{id}/permanent` (all three admin-only, matching the issue/project recycle
  bins). The whole upload body is read into memory before `Domain::validateAttachmentUpload` runs (no
  streaming/early-abort on an oversized request) -- an accepted V1 simplification, not something any
  decision calls for.
- `web/`: the issue drawer gained an "Attachments" section -- a sortable list (D101: name/size/date/
  uploader/type, client-side, matching the "ad-hoc" philosophy used for issue filters), an "Attach files"
  button plus a real drag-and-drop dropzone, and per-row delete (shown when the uploader matches the
  current user or they're a global admin, the same "client-side approximation, server enforces the real
  rule" pattern already used for comment edit/delete buttons). Clicking a file name toggles an inline
  native-element preview for the four D99 kinds (`<img>` for images, `<iframe>` for PDF and text,
  `<audio>`/`<video>` for the rest) or opens a new tab for anything else. The Markdown toolbar
  (`attachMarkdownToolbar`) gained an optional third capability, wired up everywhere an issue key is
  already known (both comment textareas, the issue-edit description) but deliberately left off the
  create-issue form's description field, since no issue exists yet to attach a file to: a 📎 toolbar
  button, real native drag-and-drop onto the textarea, and clipboard paste, all uploading and inserting
  `![name](attachment://id)` (images) or `[name](attachment://id)` (everything else) at the cursor.
  `renderMarkdownInline` gained real `![alt](url)` image-syntax support (it previously had none -- an
  unescaped literal `!` followed by a plain link) and resolves `attachment://<id>` in both image and link
  syntax to `/api/attachments/<id>/download`, validating the id shape first and leaving anything
  malformed as inert literal text, the same "safe by construction" posture as the existing
  `javascript:`-scheme guard. A new admin-only "Attachment recycle bin" nav item mirrors the audit log's
  visibility pattern (hidden by default, shown only for global admins, re-hidden on logout) and lists
  every deleted attachment across every issue (using the new `issueKey` field, since a raw internal UUID
  would be meaningless here) with restore/permanent-delete actions.

### Verification

1. `cmake --build` (full config, `-DTICKETHUB_BUILD_SERVER=ON`): zero warnings/errors from Ticket Hub's
   own files.
2. `ctest --output-on-failure`: 7/7 green. New `sqlite_integration_tests` coverage: full CRUD (create with
   a caller-supplied id, list, find, soft-delete/restore/permanent-delete, the tombstone semantics),
   `listAttachmentStorageKeysForIssue`/`...ForProject` returning keys regardless of soft-delete state, and
   rejection of an attachment on an unknown issue. New `authorization_integration_tests` coverage: upload
   permission (project-Member-or-above), delete permission (uploader-or-project-Admin-or-above, with both
   the "different member, not admin" rejection and the "global admin can delete anyone's" success case
   explicitly asserted), the fixed 25MB and blocked-extension limits, and the full recycle-bin
   authorization split (list/restore/permanent-delete all global-administrator-only). A first draft of two
   of these authorization assertions used `locator...begin()`/`.end()`-style double-evaluation (calling
   the same async listing method twice inside one `std::any_of`/`std::none_of` call, comparing iterators
   from two different temporary vectors) -- caught immediately by a nonsensical failure and fixed by
   binding the result to a local variable first.
3. Re-ran the SQLite-only and PostgreSQL-only build configurations: both compile cleanly.
4. Live PostgreSQL verification: a standalone smoke-test program (not committed) exercised
   `PostgresDatabase`'s attachment methods directly against a throwaway `tickethub_attach_test_*`
   database -- create/list/find/soft-delete/restore/permanent-delete, and both storage-key listing
   methods. The first run failed with "inconsistent types deduced for parameter $1" because the INSERT
   reused the same `$1` placeholder for both the `id` and `storage_key` columns (SQLite tolerates this;
   PostgreSQL's prepared-statement type inference does not when the two columns have different declared
   types) -- fixed by passing the id as two separate parameters. All cases passed after the fix; database
   dropped afterward.
5. Standalone Playwright/Chromium scripts, against a locally running server, SQLite, demo-seeded,
   `TICKETHUB_ATTACHMENTS_DIR` pointed at a scratch directory:
   - Uploaded a text file and an image via the "Attach files" button; confirmed both appear in the list
     with correct name/size/uploader/date; toggled the image's inline preview open and closed and
     confirmed a real `<img>` element appears/disappears; confirmed a `.exe` upload is rejected (a 400 from
     the server, a toast shown, never added to the list); confirmed the sort control actually reorders the
     visible rows; deleted an attachment and confirmed it's gone.
   - Confirmed all four D99 preview kinds render the correct native element: PDF and plain text both as
     `<iframe>`, audio as `<audio>`, video as `<video>` (each with a distinct fake file uploaded and its
     preview toggled open).
   - Confirmed real browser drag-and-drop (a synthetic `DataTransfer` dispatched as an actual `drop`
     event, not just `setInputFiles`) works both on the attachment dropzone and directly onto a comment's
     Markdown textarea, and that a real `paste` event with `clipboardData` also uploads and inserts a
     reference. A first attempt at the paste case used Playwright's `dispatchEvent(selector, 'paste',
     {clipboardData})` helper, which silently produced an event with `clipboardData` still `undefined`
     inside the page (apparently Playwright only special-cases `dataTransfer` for drag events, not
     `clipboardData` for clipboard events) -- fixed by constructing and dispatching a real
     `new ClipboardEvent('paste', {clipboardData})` from inside `page.evaluate` instead, entirely within
     the browser context.
   - Attached a file through the comment editor's 📎 toolbar button, posted the comment, and confirmed the
     rendered comment shows a real download link (with a 📎 marker) pointing at
     `/api/attachments/<id>/download` -- i.e. that `attachment://<id>` references actually resolve when
     rendered, not just when inserted.
   - Confirmed the attachment recycle bin: hidden from a non-admin, visible and populated for a global
     admin (showing the correct issue key via the new join), restore makes the attachment reappear in its
     issue, and permanent delete empties the bin.
   - A full regression re-run of the markdown/mentions/reactions/worklog/audit-log/comment-editing/
     filter-widening/dashboard-personalization/board-WIP-limits browser tests against the same build
     confirmed no regression. One dashboard-personalization assertion appeared to fail on a run late in a
     long back-to-back sequence of a dozen browser scripts against the same long-lived dev server; a
     targeted re-investigation with request/cookie logging showed the session switch and the underlying
     data were both correct the whole time -- the script's `waitForSelector` was satisfied by a *stale*
     element left over from the previous user's render (which persists until the next render actually
     starts), and the next render was simply delayed under accumulated load from a dozen prior scripts'
     SQLite traffic sharing one mutex-guarded connection. A longer explicit wait confirmed the dashboard
     was correct throughout; this was test-harness latency, not an application defect, and is recorded
     here precisely rather than glossed over.

All checks passed. No committed test scripts, fixtures, or screenshots (scratchpad only).

### What is still not built

Phase 5 (Attachments and Kanban board) is now fully implemented -- every item in
`docs/REDUCED_SCOPE_ROADMAP.md`'s Phase 5 list is done, closing out Milestone 2. Drag-and-drop *board*
reordering (distinct from the drag-and-drop *attachment* upload built in this batch) remains optional UX
polish, not required by D32 or D33. The next roadmap phase is Milestone 3 (REST API v1/export,
backup/restore/upgrade).

## 2026-08-01 — Kanban board WIP limits (D32/D33): Phase 5 slice 3

Third Phase 5 slice. Only the full attachments vertical (D15/D98-D105) remains. Drag-and-drop board
reordering was deliberately left out of this batch: neither D32 nor D33 mentions it, and the roadmap's own
Phase 5 exit gate ("board usable end-to-end") is already satisfied by click-to-drawer status changes,
which existed before this batch. It stays listed as optional UX polish in `NEXT.md`, same as before.

### What changed

- Migration `013_board_columns.sql` (both backends) adds `board_columns` -- a **single flat,
  installation-wide** table (`id`, `status_id` UNIQUE FK to `issue_statuses`, `wip_limit` nullable,
  `sort_order`), one row per fixed workflow status. This follows `docs/REDUCED_SCOPE_DATA_MODEL.md`'s
  target schema literally: no `board_id`/`project_id` column at all, matching D32's "one board column
  equals one workflow status" and D33's "cheap: one numeric field per column" reasoning. A WIP limit set
  on a column therefore applies to that status's column on *every* project's board, not per-project --
  there is no per-project board identity in the reduced-scope model. `002_seed_demo.sql` seeds the five
  rows (unlimited except "In Progress", given a demo-friendly limit of 3).
- `Domain::BoardColumn`; `IDatabase::listBoardColumns()` (ordered by `sort_order`) and
  `setBoardColumnWipLimit(statusKey, optional<int>)` (returns `false` for an unknown status key) in both
  adapters.
- `TicketService::listBoardColumns` (same read-access rule as projects/issues) and
  `setBoardColumnWipLimit` (global-administrator-only, like the anonymous-read toggle -- there is no
  per-project board-admin concept to delegate to instead); an unknown status key throws
  `std::invalid_argument`.
- New `GET /api/board-columns` and `PUT /api/board-columns/{statusKey}` routes.
- `web/`: the Board view fetches board columns alongside issues and shows each column's live count as
  `N / limit` when a limit is set (plain `N` when unlimited), applying a `.over-limit` highlight class
  (soft, display-time-only -- moving or creating issues into an over-limit column is never blocked) when
  the count exceeds the limit. Global admins additionally see a small inline number input per column to
  set/clear its WIP limit (empty input clears it back to unlimited); non-admins see the count only.

### Verification

1. `cmake --build` (full config, `-DTICKETHUB_BUILD_SERVER=ON`): zero warnings/errors from Ticket Hub's
   own files.
2. `ctest --output-on-failure`: 7/7 green. New `sqlite_integration_tests` coverage: five seeded columns in
   `sort_order`, the seeded "In Progress" limit of 3, an unlimited column reporting no limit, setting a
   limit and reading it back, clearing a limit back to unlimited, and setting a limit on an unknown status
   key returning `false`. New `authorization_integration_tests` coverage: any authenticated user can read
   board columns; setting a limit is global-administrator-only; a global admin's change is visible to any
   reader; an unknown status key throws.
3. Re-ran the SQLite-only and PostgreSQL-only build configurations: both compile cleanly.
4. Live PostgreSQL verification: a standalone smoke-test program (not committed) exercised
   `PostgresDatabase::listBoardColumns`/`setBoardColumnWipLimit` directly against a throwaway
   `tickethub_board_test_*` database -- the same five-column/seeded-limit/set/clear/unknown-key cases as
   the SQLite integration test. All passed; database dropped afterward.
5. Standalone Playwright/Chromium script, against a locally running server, SQLite, demo-seeded: logged in
   as sam (non-admin) and confirmed the board shows column counts (`"1 / 3"` for TH's seeded In Progress
   column) with no WIP-editor controls visible; logged in as demo (global admin) and confirmed the editor
   controls appear; created three more in-progress TH issues via the API to push the count to 4/3 and
   confirmed the over-limit highlight class appears; raised the limit to 10 through the real inline editor
   control and confirmed the highlight clears; cleared the limit back to unlimited; switched to the WEB
   project and confirmed its In Progress column reflects the same (cleared) limit, directly demonstrating
   the setting is genuinely installation-wide and not accidentally scoped to whichever project was open
   when it was changed.
6. Re-ran the markdown, mentions/notifications, comment-reaction, worklog, audit-log, comment
   edit/delete, filter-widening, and dashboard-personalization browser tests against the same build to
   confirm no regression -- all still pass unchanged.

All checks passed. No committed test scripts or screenshots (scratchpad only).

### What is still not built

Only the full attachments vertical (D15/D98-D105) remains in Phase 5: upload API, hardwired local
filesystem storage, upload-time SHA-256 verification, four native-element previews, sortable
list/recycle bin/90-day retention, and Markdown-editor upload/drag-drop/paste integration referencing
`attachment://UUID`. Drag-and-drop board reordering remains optional UX polish, not required by any
decision.

## 2026-08-01 — Personal dashboard widgets (D24): Phase 5 slice 2

Second Phase 5 slice. Kanban WIP limits/drag-and-drop (D33) and the attachments vertical
(D15/D98-D105) remain untouched.

### What changed

- `Domain::DashboardStats` gains `assignedToMe`, `watchedIssues`, and `upcomingDeadlines` (all
  `std::vector<Issue>`), alongside the pre-existing installation-wide counts and `recentIssues`. Matches
  D24's fixed personal-dashboard widget set (assigned issues, watched issues, recent activity, deadlines,
  simple stats) minus the active-sprint widget, which D24 itself drops since Scrum was removed for V1.
- New `IDatabase::listWatchedIssues(userId, limit)` in both adapters -- the reverse direction of the
  existing `listWatchers` (which lists watchers of one issue; this lists issues watched by one user),
  newest-updated first.
- `TicketService::dashboard` now personalizes for an authenticated actor: `assignedToMe` reuses the
  existing `listIssues` assignee filter (no new query) and excludes Done-category issues; `upcomingDeadlines`
  is derived from that same result set app-side (open issues with a due date, soonest first) rather than a
  second database round trip; `watchedIssues` calls the new `listWatchedIssues`. All three stay empty for
  an anonymous viewer (no personal identity to personalize for) -- a conservative default, since D24's
  decision text describes this as a *personal* dashboard.
- `GET /api/dashboard` response gains `assignedToMe`/`watchedIssues`/`upcomingDeadlines` arrays.
- `web/`: the Dashboard view gains three new panels (reusing the existing `tablePanel` helper for
  "Assigned to me" and "Issues I'm watching"; a new small `deadlinesPanel` helper, structurally identical
  but with a Due date column, for "Upcoming deadlines") shown only when a principal is present.

### Verification

1. `cmake --build` (full config, `-DTICKETHUB_BUILD_SERVER=ON`): zero warnings/errors from Ticket Hub's
   own files.
2. `ctest --output-on-failure`: 7/7 green. New `sqlite_integration_tests` coverage for `listWatchedIssues`
   (returns exactly the issues a given user is watching, empty for a user watching nothing). New
   `authorization_integration_tests` coverage for `TicketService::dashboard`: an anonymous viewer (with
   anonymous read temporarily enabled, since dashboard access itself requires read access) gets empty
   personal widgets; alex's `assignedToMe` excludes the Done-category TH-1 while including the open TH-3
   and WEB-1; `watchedIssues` reflects a newly watched issue.
3. Re-ran the SQLite-only and PostgreSQL-only build configurations: both compile cleanly.
4. Live PostgreSQL verification: a standalone smoke-test program (not committed) exercised
   `PostgresDatabase::listWatchedIssues` directly -- multiple users watching different/overlapping issues,
   the `limit` parameter capping the result, and cleanup unwatching returning to empty. All passed, against
   a throwaway `tickethub_dash_test_*` database, dropped afterward.
5. Standalone Playwright/Chromium script, against a locally running server, SQLite, demo-seeded: logged in
   as alex and confirmed the dashboard shows exactly three new panels in the expected order and that
   "Assigned to me" contains WEB-1 and TH-3 but not the Done-category TH-1; watched TH-2 through the real
   issue-drawer Watch button and confirmed the "Issues I'm watching" panel picks it up after returning to
   the dashboard; confirmed the deadlines panel shows its empty state when no seed issue has a due date,
   then separately set a real due date on TH-3 via the edit API and confirmed it appears in the deadlines
   panel with the correct formatted date; logged in as sam and confirmed sam's own "Assigned to me" shows
   sam's issues (TH-2, WEB-2) and not alex's TH-3, i.e. the personalization is actually per-actor and not a
   shared global list. A first draft of this browser script produced confusing results from state left over
   by an earlier failed run (a stale watch on TH-2 from a script that crashed on a drawer-backdrop click
   interception); re-running the script against a freshly reseeded server produced clean, correct results,
   confirming the earlier confusion was test-script state pollution, not an application bug.
6. Re-ran the markdown, mentions/notifications, comment-reaction, worklog, audit-log, comment
   edit/delete, and filter-widening browser tests against the same build to confirm no regression -- all
   still pass unchanged.

All checks passed. No committed test scripts or screenshots (scratchpad only).

### What is still not built

Phase 5's remaining items: Kanban board WIP limits and drag-and-drop (D33 plus the roadmap's own "usable
end-to-end" exit-gate wording), and the full attachments vertical (D15/D98-D105). Both untouched by this
batch.

## 2026-08-01 — Ad-hoc issue filter/search widening (D10/D43): Phase 5 slice 1

First Phase 5 (Attachments and Kanban board) slice. `docs/REDUCED_SCOPE_ROADMAP.md`'s Phase 5 list also
covers dashboard personalization (D24), Kanban WIP limits/drag-and-drop (D33), and the full attachments
vertical (D15/D98-D105); none of those are touched by this batch.

### What changed

- `Domain::IssueFilter` gains `issueTypeKey`, `priorityKey`, `assigneeEmail`, `label`, and `dueBefore`
  (all optional, alongside the pre-existing `projectKey`/`statusKey`/`search`) -- still the ad-hoc,
  in-UI-only filter model from D10: no saved/shared filters, no JQL, not usable as a webhook or board
  source.
- `SqliteDatabase::listIssues`/`PostgresDatabase::listIssues` both widened to the same 8-parameter
  `WHERE` clause: type/priority/assignee are plain equality joins against already-present aliases;
  `dueBefore` is an inclusive `<=` comparison; `label` is a fresh `EXISTS` subquery against
  `issue_labels`/`labels` (SQLite) or `issue_labels`/`labels` (PostgreSQL) rather than a condition on the
  already-aggregated label-list column, so a label filter narrows *which issues* match without dropping
  any of a matching issue's *other* labels from its displayed label list; `search` now also matches
  `i.description`, not just summary/issue key, per D43's "simple `LIKE`/`ILIKE` substring match, no
  full-text index" scope.
- `GET /api/issues` accepts new `type`, `priority`, `assignee`, `label`, and `dueBefore` query parameters.
  `TicketService::listIssues` needed no change -- it already passed the filter through unchanged.
- `web/`: the Issues view's filter bar gains type/priority/assignee dropdowns (fixed catalogs, matching
  the create-issue form's own hardcoded option lists), a label text input, and a due-date picker,
  alongside the pre-existing project/status/search controls. "Clear" and the Board/global-search
  transitions all reset the new fields too, so a lingering ad-hoc filter from the Issues view can't
  silently leak into the Board view or a fresh global search.

### Verification

1. `cmake --build` (full config, `-DTICKETHUB_BUILD_SERVER=ON`): zero warnings/errors from Ticket Hub's
   own files.
2. `ctest --output-on-failure`: 7/7 green, including new `sqlite_integration_tests` assertions covering
   each new filter field individually, a combined multi-field filter, the inclusive `dueBefore` boundary,
   the widened description search, and an explicit check that filtering by label does not mutate or
   truncate the filtered issue's own label list.
3. Re-ran the SQLite-only and PostgreSQL-only build configurations: both compile cleanly.
4. Live PostgreSQL verification: a standalone smoke-test program (not committed) exercised the widened
   `PostgresDatabase::listIssues` directly -- created and edited an issue, then asserted the same
   type/priority/assignee/label/dueBefore/description-search cases as the SQLite integration test, plus
   that the label filter leaves the LATERAL-aggregated label list intact. All passed, against a throwaway
   `tickethub_filter_test_*` database, dropped afterward.
5. Standalone Playwright/Chromium script, against a locally running server, SQLite, demo-seeded: verified
   each new filter control in isolation (type=bug, priority=highest, assignee=alex, label=backend,
   description-only search text) narrows the Issues table to exactly the expected row(s); verified
   "Clear" restores the full unfiltered list; verified a combined project+type filter narrows correctly;
   verified the Board view does not inherit a filter left set on the Issues view. Also directly confirmed
   the default project preselection on first opening the Issues view is pre-existing behavior (unrelated
   to this batch) and not a filter-widening regression, and that an empty-result table's "No issues
   found" placeholder row was the source of an initial miscount in a throwaway debug script, not an
   application bug.
6. Re-ran the markdown, mentions/notifications, comment-reaction, worklog, audit-log, and comment
   edit/delete browser tests against the same build to confirm no regression -- all still pass unchanged.

All checks passed. No committed test scripts or screenshots (scratchpad only).

### What is still not built

Phase 5's remaining items: dashboard personalization (D24), Kanban board WIP limits and drag-and-drop
(D33 plus the roadmap's own "usable end-to-end" exit-gate wording), and the full attachments vertical
(D15/D98-D105) -- upload API, local filesystem storage, native-element previews, recycle bin, retention,
and Markdown-editor integration. All untouched by this batch.

## 2026-07-31 — Simple append-only admin/security audit log (D23): Phase 4 complete

Sixth and final Phase 4 (Collaboration) slice. With this batch, every item in
`docs/REDUCED_SCOPE_ROADMAP.md`'s Phase 4 list is implemented.

### What changed

- Migration `012_audit_log.sql` (both backends) adds `audit_events` (`id`, `category`, `action`,
  `actor_user_id` nullable `ON DELETE SET NULL`, `target_type`/`target_id` nullable, `details` nullable,
  `created_at`) -- a simplified version of the original baseline schema (`docs/DATA_MODEL.md`): no
  `actor_type`/`project_id`/`ip_address`/`correlation_id`/`before_json`/`after_json`/`metadata_json`
  columns, and no separate `audit_retention_policies` table. Rows are appended and never updated or
  purged, matching D23's "no categories[-as-a-retention-feature], export, or configurable retention"
  simplification.
- `Domain::AuditEvent`; `IDatabase::recordAuditEvent` (fire-and-forget, returns `void` -- unlike
  `createNotification`, whose result the notification list feature reads back immediately) and
  `listAuditEvents(limit)` (newest-first, no pagination/filtering) in both adapters.
- Wired into a small, deliberately focused set of existing call sites rather than a general-purpose
  audit hook on every write: `AuthService::login` on a wrong password (`auth`/`login.failed`) or an
  attempt against an already-locked account (`auth`/`login.blocked`); `AuthService::createUser`
  (`identity`/`user.created`, with no actor since `ticket-hub-cli create-user` runs outside any web
  session); `TicketService::setAnonymousReadEnabled`/`permanentlyDeleteProject`/`permanentlyDeleteIssue`
  (all `admin`-category, attributed to the acting global administrator).
- `TicketService::listAuditEvents` (global-administrator-only, same level as the recycle bins) and a new
  `GET /api/admin/audit-events` route.
- `web/`: a new "Audit log" nav item, hidden by default and shown only for global admins
  (`renderCurrentUser`), and re-hidden on logout (`showLoginScreen`) so it can't leak to whoever logs in
  next in the same browser tab. Renders a simple read-only table (when, category, action, actor, target,
  details) via a new `renderAuditLog()` view, reusing the existing `.issue-table`/`.panel` styles rather
  than introducing new CSS.

### Verification

1. `cmake --build` (full config, `-DTICKETHUB_BUILD_SERVER=ON`): zero warnings/errors from Ticket Hub's
   own files.
2. `ctest --output-on-failure`: 7/7 green, including new assertions in `sqlite_integration_tests`
   (`recordAuditEvent`/`listAuditEvents` round-trip with and without an actor, newest-first ordering,
   the `limit` parameter capping the result size), `identity_integration_tests` (a failed login records
   `auth`/`login.failed`, a blocked login records `auth`/`login.blocked`, a CLI-driven `createUser`
   records `identity`/`user.created` with no actor), and `authorization_integration_tests`
   (`listAuditEvents` is global-administrator-only; `permanentlyDeleteIssue`, `setAnonymousReadEnabled`,
   and `permanentlyDeleteProject` each produce their expected event, all correctly attributed to the
   actor who performed the action).
3. Re-ran the SQLite-only and PostgreSQL-only build configurations: both compile cleanly.
4. Live PostgreSQL verification: a standalone smoke-test program (not committed) exercised
   `recordAuditEvent`/`listAuditEvents` directly against `PostgresDatabase`, then separately confirmed
   (via the same live database) that a `ticket-hub-cli create-user` invocation against that same database
   -- run through the actual CLI binary, not a direct database call -- had already produced an
   `identity`/`user.created` audit row with no actor. All passed.
5. Standalone Playwright/Chromium script, against a locally running server, SQLite, demo-seeded: logged
   in as `sam` (non-admin) and confirmed the "Audit log" nav item is not visible; logged out and
   confirmed the nav item is hidden again (not just for the just-logged-out user, but as a state reset
   before the next login); logged in as `demo` (global admin) and confirmed the nav item is visible;
   toggled the anonymous-read-access setting on and off via two direct API calls (to generate two
   deterministic events without depending on incidental audit activity elsewhere); opened the Audit log
   view and confirmed at least two rows appeared, with the first row's text containing both
   `settings.anonymous_read_changed` and the actor's display name ("Demo User").
6. Re-ran the reaction, comment-editing, mentions/notifications, and worklog browser tests against the
   same build to confirm no regression -- all still pass unchanged.

All checks passed. No committed test scripts or screenshots (scratchpad only).

### What is still not built

Phase 4 (Collaboration) is now fully implemented. Phase 5 (attachments and the Kanban board) is
untouched and is the natural next step. The audit log itself has no export, filtering beyond the fixed
200-row cap, or configurable retention -- not a gap, but D23's explicit V1 scope.

## 2026-07-31 — Simplified worklogs (D12/D13)

Fifth Phase 4 (Collaboration) slice, and the last one before D23 (audit log) closes out the phase: issues
can now have time logged against them.

### What changed

- Migration `011_worklogs.sql` (both backends) adds `worklogs` (`id`, `issue_id`, `author_user_id`,
  `work_date`, `time_spent_seconds`, `comment` nullable, `deleted_at`/`deleted_by_user_id`, `created_at`,
  `updated_at`, `version`) -- no `remaining_adjustment_mode`/`remaining_estimate_seconds_after` columns
  from the original baseline schema, since D12 dropped time estimates from V1 entirely.
- `Domain::Worklog`/`AddWorklogRequest`/`EditWorklogRequest`; `Domain::validateAddWorklog`/
  `validateEditWorklog` (workDate required, timeSpentSeconds in `(0, 3600000]` seconds, comment ≤ 10000
  chars).
- `IDatabase::listWorklogs`/`addWorklog`/`findWorklogById`/`editWorklog`/`deleteWorklog` in both
  adapters, mirroring the comment CRUD implementation exactly: `editWorklog` shares `editComment`/
  `editIssue`'s optimistic-locking contract (`expectedVersion` -> `Domain::ConcurrencyConflict`);
  `deleteWorklog` is a tombstone delete.
- `TicketService::addWorklog`/`editWorklog`/`deleteWorklog`: deliberately drop D83's author-or-admin
  permission split. All three require only project-Member-or-above on the issue's project -- the same
  level as any other issue write -- so any project member may edit or delete *any* worklog on an issue
  they can access, not just the one they logged themselves. This is D13's explicit simplification
  ("no separate own-vs-others edit/delete permission split"), and is deliberately more permissive than
  comments.
- `Api.cpp`: new `GET`/`POST /api/issues/{key}/worklogs` and `PATCH`/`DELETE
  /api/issues/{key}/worklogs/{id}` routes, following the established auth/CSRF/error-mapping pattern.
- `web/`: a "Time tracking" section in the issue drawer. `formatDuration`/`parseDurationToSeconds`
  convert between a plain integer of seconds and a free-text "1h 30m" style duration. Each logged entry
  shows a Delete button unconditionally (no client-side author check, since the server itself allows any
  project member to delete any entry -- unlike comments, where the client hides Edit/Delete for
  non-authors as a UX simplification). The log-time form's duration field has an HTML5 `pattern`
  attribute as a first line of defense against malformed input, plus a JS-level parse-and-toast fallback.

### Verification

1. `cmake --build` (full config, `-DTICKETHUB_BUILD_SERVER=ON`): zero warnings/errors from Ticket Hub's
   own files.
2. `ctest --output-on-failure`: 7/7 green, including new assertions in `sqlite_integration_tests` (full
   CRUD round-trip, version increment on edit, stale-version conflict, tombstone semantics -- excluded
   from listing/lookup but the row still physically present) and `authorization_integration_tests` (a
   non-member rejected on another project's issue; a different project member editing and then deleting
   someone else's worklog both succeed, explicitly asserting the no-own-vs-others-split behavior; editing
   an unknown worklog id still respects the project-role check before the not-found path; unknown-worklog
   edit/delete return nullopt/false rather than throwing).
3. Re-ran the SQLite-only and PostgreSQL-only build configurations: both compile cleanly.
4. Live PostgreSQL verification: a standalone smoke-test program (not committed) exercised `addWorklog`/
   `listWorklogs`/`findWorklogById`/`editWorklog` (including the stale-version-conflict rejection) and
   `deleteWorklog` directly against `PostgresDatabase` and a local PostgreSQL 16 server -- all passed.
5. Standalone Playwright/Chromium script, against a locally running server, SQLite, demo-seeded: opened
   an issue with no logged time and confirmed the empty state; logged "1h 30m" with a comment and
   confirmed the row shows both the correctly-formatted duration and the comment text; deleted the entry
   and confirmed the list returns to empty; submitted a garbage duration value and confirmed no new
   worklog row appeared -- the input's HTML5 `pattern` attribute blocks the browser's native form
   submission before the JS `submit` handler (and its `parseDurationToSeconds` fallback) ever fires, so
   this particular check exercised the HTML5-level guard, not the JS-level one; the JS fallback exists
   for completeness (e.g. a submission path that bypasses native validation) but was not itself
   triggered by this check.

All checks passed. No committed test scripts or screenshots (scratchpad only).

### What is still not built

Only D23 (the append-only admin/security audit log) remains open in Phase 4. Phase 5 (attachments and
the Kanban board) is untouched. There is no worklog totals/summary view (e.g. "time logged this week"),
just the per-issue list -- not called for by D12/D13's simplification.

## 2026-07-31 — Markdown editor toolbar, live preview, and sanitized rendering (D16)

Fourth Phase 4 (Collaboration) slice: comment bodies and issue descriptions now render as formatted
Markdown, with a visual toolbar and a live preview toggle. Entirely a `web/` change -- no schema or API
change, since bodies are still stored/transmitted as raw Markdown text.

### What changed

- `renderMarkdownInline`/`renderMarkdown`: a deliberately small Markdown-to-HTML subset -- bold
  (`**x**`), italic (`*x*`), inline code, links, `#`/`##`/`###` headings, `-`/`*` and `1.` lists, `>`
  blockquotes, fenced code blocks, `---`/`***` horizontal rules. Safe by construction: the raw text is
  HTML-escaped *first* (the same `escapeHtml` used everywhere else in `web/`), and every subsequent
  transform only wraps the already-escaped text in a fixed, hardcoded set of tags -- user input can never
  introduce a real HTML tag or attribute this way, so there is no separate sanitization pass that could be
  wrong. Link targets are restricted to `http(s)`/`mailto` via a scheme check on the captured URL; any
  other scheme is left as literal `[text](url)` text rather than becoming a clickable anchor.
- `attachMarkdownToolbar`: Bold/Italic/Code/Link/Bulleted-list/Numbered-list/Quote buttons plus a
  Preview toggle, wired to all four Markdown-capable textareas -- comment add, comment edit, issue
  description on create, issue description on edit. Pure `textarea.selectionStart`/`selectionEnd`
  manipulation (wrap-selection for inline styles, prefix-each-line for block styles), no
  `execCommand`/`contenteditable`, so the field stays a real `<textarea>` and every existing
  FormData-based submit handler and the @mention autocomplete (which reads `selectionStart` directly)
  keep working unchanged.
- `.comment-body-text` changed from a `<p>` to a `<div class="markdown-body">` (a `<p>` cannot legally
  contain block-level children like `<ul>`/`<blockquote>`/`<h2>`, which `renderMarkdown` can now produce).
  The issue drawer's Description section renders through the same path.

### A rendering bug caught and fixed during implementation

The first cut of the italic regex accepted `_..._` as an alternative to `*...*` (matching the common
Markdown convention of supporting both delimiters for both bold and italic). This mishandled any text
containing two separate double-underscore identifiers -- e.g. two `__dunder__`-style names, or in the
XSS test payload below, `window.__xssFired` appearing twice -- because the regex engine matched an
underscore from the *first* pair as an opening delimiter and an underscore from the *second* pair as the
closing one, silently swallowing everything in between (including other underscore-delimited content)
into a single `<em>` span. The output remained safely escaped throughout (this was never an XSS risk,
just visually wrong), but it was still a real correctness bug. Caught by a Playwright assertion that
expected specific literal text to be present in a comment and found it missing, split across an
unexpected `<em>` boundary. Fixed by dropping underscore-delimited emphasis entirely -- bold and italic
now use only `**`/`*`, which have no adjacency ambiguity since a bare `*` can never be confused with a
`**` pair, and there's no snake_case-style convention for single asterisks the way there is for single
underscores.

### Verification

1. `node --check web/app.js`: no syntax errors (this batch made no C++ changes, so no `cmake --build`
   was needed for the feature itself; `ctest --output-on-failure` was still re-run to confirm no
   unrelated regression -- 7/7 green, unchanged from the previous batch).
2. Standalone Playwright/Chromium script, against a locally running server, SQLite, demo-seeded:
   - Toolbar: typed "hello world", selected "world", clicked the Bold button, confirmed the textarea
     value became `hello **world**`.
   - Preview: clicked the Preview toggle, confirmed the preview pane's HTML contains `<strong>world</strong>`,
     confirmed the textarea itself is hidden while previewing, then toggled back and confirmed the
     textarea is visible again.
   - Posted a comment containing bold/italic/inline-code/a link/a bulleted list/a blockquote, and
     confirmed the rendered comment contains exactly the expected `<strong>`/`<em>`/`<code>`/`<a href=
     "https://example.com">`/`<ul><li>`/`<blockquote>` elements (not literal asterisks/brackets).
   - **Security check 1**: posted a comment whose entire body was
     `<script>window.__xssFired = true;</script> and <img src=x onerror="window.__xssFired = true">`.
     Confirmed via `page.evaluate` that `window.__xssFired` was never set to `true` (the payload never
     executed), and confirmed the literal text is visible in the rendered comment (proving it was
     escaped and displayed, not silently dropped).
   - **Security check 2**: posted a comment `[click me](javascript:alert(1))` and confirmed the rendered
     comment contains zero `<a>` elements -- the `javascript:` scheme was rejected and the text rendered
     as literal `[click me](javascript:alert(1))`, not a clickable link.
   - Edited an issue's description to `## Heading\n\nSome **bold** description text.` and confirmed the
     rendered description contains both an `<h2>` and a `<strong>`.
3. Re-ran the eighth batch's reaction browser test, the seventh batch's comment-editing browser test, and
   the ninth batch's mentions/notifications browser test against the same build to confirm no regression
   from the `.comment-body-text` markup change (`<p>` to `<div>`) or the new toolbar/preview DOM elements
   -- all three still pass unchanged.

All checks passed (after the underscore-emphasis bug above was found and fixed). No committed test
scripts or screenshots (scratchpad only).

### What is still not built

The rest of Phase 4 remains unimplemented: simplified worklogs (D13) and the append-only admin/security
audit log (D23). Phase 5 (attachments and the Kanban board) is untouched. The Markdown renderer is
intentionally a small subset -- no tables, no nested lists, no strikethrough, no images -- consistent
with "a deliberately small subset, not a general-purpose engine" rather than a gap to fill later.

## 2026-07-31 — @mention handles and the fixed in-app notification set (D56/D80/D14)

Third Phase 4 (Collaboration) slice: users can now have an optional, unique @mention handle; comments are
scanned for `@handle` mentions at creation; and three fixed notification types (assigned, mentioned,
comment on a watched issue) are created as a side effect of existing writes and surfaced through a new
notification bell in the UI.

### What changed

- Migration `010_mentions_and_notifications.sql` (both backends) adds `users.handle` (nullable, unique
  via a partial index -- SQLite's `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` cannot itself carry a `UNIQUE` constraint) and
  `notifications` (`id`, `user_id`, `type` CHECK-constrained to `assigned`/`mentioned`/`watched_comment`,
  `issue_id` nullable `ON DELETE CASCADE`, `read_at` nullable, `created_at`) -- the exact minimal shape
  documented in `docs/REDUCED_SCOPE_DATA_MODEL.md`.
- `Domain::User`/`CreateUserRequest` gained `handle`; `Domain::Notification` and the three fixed
  `NotificationType*` constants; `Domain::normalizeHandle`/`isValidHandle` (lowercase, 1-32
  letters/digits/underscores, same normalization style as email).
- `IDatabase` gained `findUserByHandle` and `createNotification`/`listNotifications`/
  `countUnreadNotifications`/`markNotificationRead`/`markAllNotificationsRead`, implemented in both
  adapters. `listNotifications`/`createNotification` resolve `issueKey`/`issueSummary` at read time via a
  `LEFT JOIN` on `issues`, since there is no stored message string.
- `AuthService::createUser` normalizes and pre-checks handle uniqueness the same way it already does for
  email (not relying on the database constraint's error message); `ticket-hub-cli create-user` gained
  `--handle=<handle>`. The three seeded demo users (`002_seed_demo.sql`, both backends) now have handles
  `demo`/`alex`/`sam`.
- `TicketService::createIssue`/`editIssue` compare the issue's assignee before and after the write and
  notify a newly-set or changed assignee -- skipping self-assignment and a no-op re-save with the same
  assignee. `TicketService::addComment` extracts every distinct `@handle` token from the comment body
  with a plain regex (once, at creation -- `editComment` does not re-scan, to avoid re-notifying on every
  save of an already-mentioning comment), resolves each against `findUserByHandle`, and notifies each
  resolved user (other than the comment's own author) plus every current watcher of the issue (other than
  the author) -- deduplicated so a recipient who is both mentioned and watching the same comment gets
  exactly one notification, "mentioned" winning over the generic "watched_comment".
- `Api.cpp`: new `GET /api/users` (a slim directory listing -- id/displayName/email/handle only --
  requiring a session even when anonymous read is on, since the user directory is more sensitive than
  issue data) and `GET /api/notifications[?unread=true]`, `GET /api/notifications/unread-count`,
  `POST /api/notifications/{id}/read`, `POST /api/notifications/read-all`, all scoped to the caller's own
  notifications. Also removed a stale "this file could not be compiled" comment at the top of `Api.cpp`
  left over from before the server target was first built and verified this session -- no longer
  accurate and actively misleading.
- `web/`: a notification bell with an unread-count badge in the top bar (`loadBaseData()` fetches the
  count once per login/init); clicking it opens a panel listing every notification (`renderNotificationPanel`),
  each clickable to mark it read and open the related issue, plus a "mark all read" button. An @mention
  autocomplete dropdown (`attachMentionAutocomplete`) is attached to both the add-comment textarea and the
  edit-comment textarea: typing `@partial` shows up to 5 matching handles from the cached `/api/users`
  directory (fetched once in `loadBaseData()`, no per-keystroke network request), and clicking a
  suggestion replaces the partial token with the full `@handle `.

### A design correction caught while writing the authorization test

The first draft of the notification authorization test accumulated state on a single shared issue across
sub-tests (assign, then reassign, then comment-mention, then watch, then comment-again), asserting
absolute unread counts at each step. This broke as soon as a later sub-test's comment triggered a
`watched_comment` notification for a user still watching from an earlier sub-test -- an interaction the
absolute-count assertions hadn't accounted for. Caught immediately by a failing assertion, not by
production behavior being wrong. Fixed by giving each notification type (`assigned`, `mentioned`,
`watched_comment`, and the mentioned-wins-over-watched dedupe) its own dedicated issue and calling
`markAllNotificationsRead` as an explicit reset between sub-tests, so no sub-test's side effects can leak
into the next one's assertions.

### Verification

1. `cmake --build` (full config, `-DTICKETHUB_BUILD_SERVER=ON`): zero warnings/errors from Ticket Hub's
   own files.
2. `ctest --output-on-failure`: 7/7 green, including new assertions in `sqlite_integration_tests`
   (`findUserByHandle` resolving/rejecting, `createNotification` resolving the issue key, `listNotifications`/
   `countUnreadNotifications` with the `unreadOnly` filter, `markNotificationRead`/`markAllNotificationsRead`
   idempotency and per-user scoping), `identity_integration_tests` (handle lowercased on create, a
   duplicate handle rejected even with different casing, an invalid handle format rejected, the handle
   remaining optional), and `authorization_integration_tests` (assigned/self-assigned/unchanged-reassign,
   mentioned/unknown-handle/self-mention, watched-comment/self-watch-self-comment, the
   mentioned-wins-over-watched dedupe, `listUsers` returning the seeded handles, and per-user scoping of
   mark-read/mark-all-read).
3. Re-ran the SQLite-only and PostgreSQL-only build configurations: both compile cleanly.
4. Live PostgreSQL verification: `ticket-hub-cli create-user ... --handle=extra_user` against a local
   PostgreSQL 16 server, followed by a standalone smoke-test program (not committed) exercising
   `findUserByHandle` and all five notification methods directly against `PostgresDatabase` -- all passed.
5. Standalone Playwright/Chromium script, against a locally running server, SQLite, demo-seeded: logged in
   as `demo`, created an issue assigned to `alex` (auto-opens its drawer), typed `@sa` in the comment box
   and confirmed a "@sam — Sam Lee" autocomplete suggestion appeared and, on click, inserted `@sam ` into
   the textarea; posted the comment. Logged out, logged in as `alex`: unread badge read "1"; opened the
   notification panel, confirmed the single item's type was "assigned"; clicking it opened the issue
   drawer and marked it read (badge went to hidden/0). Logged out, logged in as `sam`: unread badge read
   "1"; the notification's type was "mentioned" and its summary referenced the correct issue key;
   "mark all read" cleared the badge. Re-ran with a second, isolated instance of the same script against a
   freshly reset database to rule out cross-run state contamination, confirming identical results.
6. Re-ran the eighth batch's reaction browser test and the seventh batch's comment-editing browser test
   against the same build to confirm no regression from the new notification-bell markup and mention
   autocomplete wrapper elements -- both still pass unchanged.

All checks passed. No committed test scripts or screenshots (scratchpad only).

### What is still not built

The rest of Phase 4 remains unimplemented: the full Markdown editor/toolbar/preview (D16), simplified
worklogs (D13), and the append-only admin/security audit log (D23). Phase 5 (attachments and the Kanban
board) is untouched. There is still no self-service profile editing -- a handle can only be set at
account creation via the CLI, not changed afterward.

## 2026-07-31 — Fixed emoji reactions on comments (D84)

Second Phase 4 (Collaboration) slice: comments can now receive a fixed set of emoji reactions, mirroring
the existing self-service watch/vote pattern (D20/D79).

### What changed

- Migration `009_comment_reactions.sql` (both backends) adds `comment_reactions`: a three-column
  composite-primary-key many-to-many table (`comment_id`, `user_id`, `reaction_key`), `ON DELETE CASCADE`
  on both foreign keys, `reaction_key` constrained (`CHECK`) to a fixed eight-value set. The decision
  register (D84) calls for "a fixed reaction set" without naming one, so this uses GitHub's own
  well-known set (`thumbs_up`, `thumbs_down`, `laugh`, `hooray`, `confused`, `heart`, `rocket`, `eyes`) as
  a conservative, familiar default -- a filled product-decision gap, documented here and in `docs/SCHEMA.md`.
- `Domain::CommentReaction` (`reactionKey` + `UserSummary user`) and `Domain::isValidCommentReactionKey`.
- `IDatabase` gained `addCommentReaction`/`removeCommentReaction` (idempotent: return `true` only when a
  row was actually inserted/removed, matching `watchIssue`/`voteIssue`) and `listCommentReactions`
  (returns the raw `(reactionKey, user)` rows for a comment). Implemented in both `SqliteDatabase` and
  `PostgresDatabase`.
- `TicketService::addCommentReaction`/`removeCommentReaction`/`listCommentReactions`: no project-role
  check, same reasoning as watch/vote -- any authenticated user may react to any comment. Unlike
  `editComment`/`deleteComment`'s nullopt/false not-found convention, an unknown issue, comment, or
  reaction key throws `std::invalid_argument`, matching `watchIssue`'s own unknown-issue behavior (chosen
  deliberately so the add/remove boolean can keep meaning "idempotent no-op" without being overloaded
  with a second, conflicting "not found" meaning -- see the design note below).
- `Api.cpp`: new `GET /api/issues/{key}/comments/{id}/reactions` and
  `POST`/`DELETE /api/issues/{key}/comments/{id}/reactions/{key}` routes, following the established
  auth/CSRF/error-mapping pattern. The POST/DELETE handlers ignore the service-layer boolean entirely
  (mirroring the existing watch/vote route handlers) and always return `{ok: true}` on success, since a
  not-found now throws instead.
- `web/app.js`: a `COMMENT_REACTIONS` catalog (key + emoji) drives a row of eight pill buttons under each
  comment, fetched via one reactions request per comment alongside the existing per-issue fetches. Each
  button shows a live count and highlights (`.reaction-button--active`) when the current viewer has that
  reaction; clicking POSTs or DELETEs depending on the button's current state and re-renders. `web/styles.css`
  gained `.comment-reactions`/`.reaction-button`/`.reaction-button--active`.

### A design correction caught during implementation

The first cut of `TicketService::addCommentReaction`/`removeCommentReaction` returned `false` for "the
comment does not exist" -- copying `editComment`/`deleteComment`'s convention -- while also trying to
return the database layer's own idempotency signal (`true` only if a row was newly inserted/removed) on
the success path. Those two conflate into one `bool`: a `false` could mean either "already reacted,
harmless" or "comment does not exist, and reacting silently failed" and the caller could not tell which.
Caught by a newly written test (`reacting again with the same key is a no-op` failed after the return
value was collapsed to always `true` on success) before this ever reached the API layer. Fixed by making
unknown-issue/comment/key cases throw `std::invalid_argument` instead of returning `false`, freeing the
boolean to mean only "idempotent no-op" -- consistent with `watchIssue`'s own behavior, which already
throws for an unknown issue key rather than returning `false`.

### Verification

1. `cmake --build` (full config, `-DTICKETHUB_BUILD_SERVER=ON`): zero warnings/errors from Ticket Hub's
   own files.
2. `ctest --output-on-failure`: 7/7 green, including new assertions in `sqlite_integration_tests`
   (react/react-again-no-op/second-user-same-key/second-key-same-user, `listCommentReactions` count,
   remove/remove-again-no-op, remaining-count-after-remove) and `authorization_integration_tests`
   (a non-project-member can still react, `listCommentReactions` visible to any authenticated reader,
   removing one's own reaction, an unknown reaction key rejected, reacting/un-reacting to an unknown
   comment rejected).
3. Re-ran the SQLite-only and PostgreSQL-only build configurations: both compile cleanly (SQLite-only
   naturally excludes the SQLite-specific integration/identity/authorization/workflow test binaries when
   SQLite itself is off, as already documented; PostgreSQL-only compiles the core/CLI/domain/migration/
   crypto targets).
4. Live PostgreSQL verification: a standalone smoke-test program (not committed) exercised
   `addCommentReaction`/`removeCommentReaction`/`listCommentReactions` directly against
   `PostgresDatabase` and a local PostgreSQL 16 server (created and dropped for this check), alongside a
   re-check of `findCommentById`/`editComment` from the prior batch -- all passed.
5. Standalone Playwright/Chromium script, against a locally running server, SQLite, demo-seeded: logged
   in as `demo`, added a comment, confirmed all eight reaction buttons render; clicked `thumbs_up` and
   confirmed it goes active with a "1" count; clicked it again and confirmed it reverts to inactive with
   no count; clicked `heart` and confirmed it can be active alongside the (now inactive) `thumbs_up`
   button. Logged out, logged in as `alex`, opened the same issue, and confirmed the `heart` count reads
   "1" (shared state, correct before alex has reacted); clicked `heart` as alex and confirmed the count
   becomes "2". A second, focused script explicitly asserted the `reaction-button--active` CSS class
   (not just the visible count) before and after alex's own click, confirming alex's own highlight starts
   `false` (only demo had reacted) and flips to `true` only after alex's own click -- the count and the
   per-viewer highlight are tracked independently, as intended.
6. Re-ran the full comment-editing/tombstone-delete browser test from the previous batch against the same
   build to confirm no regression from the new reaction markup inside each comment -- unchanged pass.

All checks passed. No committed test scripts or screenshots (scratchpad only).

### What is still not built

The rest of Phase 4 remains unimplemented: the full Markdown editor/toolbar/preview (D16), `@handle`
mentions with autocomplete (D80, needs a new `users.handle` column, D56), the fixed in-app notification
set (D14), simplified worklogs (D13), and the append-only admin/security audit log (D23). Phase 5
(attachments and the Kanban board) is untouched.

## 2026-07-31 — Comment editing and tombstone delete (D81/D82/D83): Phase 4 started

First Phase 4 (Collaboration) slice: comments can now be edited (with an `edited_at` marker, D81) and
tombstone-deleted (soft delete via the same columns issues/projects already use, D82), with simplified
author-or-project-admin permissions (D83).

### What changed

- Migration `008_comment_editing.sql` (both backends) adds `comments.edited_at` (`TEXT` on SQLite,
  `TIMESTAMPTZ` on PostgreSQL).
- `Domain::Comment` gained `editedAt` (`std::optional<std::string>`).
- `IDatabase` gained `findCommentById`, `editComment` (same optimistic-locking contract as `editIssue`:
  a mismatched `expectedVersion` throws `Domain::ConcurrencyConflict`; sets `edited_at` and bumps
  `version` on success), and `deleteComment` (tombstone soft-delete, mirrors `softDeleteIssue` exactly).
  Implemented in both `SqliteDatabase` and `PostgresDatabase`, sharing a `readComment`/`CommentSelect`
  helper with the existing `listComments`/`addComment` (which were rewritten to use it instead of
  duplicating the column list).
- `TicketService` gained `editComment`/`deleteComment`: the comment's own author may always act on it;
  otherwise the actor needs project-Admin-or-above on the comment's issue's project (checked via the
  existing `requireProjectRole`, which already bypasses for global admins -- no separate check needed).
- `Api.cpp`: `commentJson` now includes `version`/`editedAt`; new `PATCH`/
  `DELETE /api/issues/{key}/comments/{id}` routes follow the established auth/CSRF/error-mapping pattern
  (`Domain::ConcurrencyConflict` -> 409, `Domain::Forbidden` -> 403, `std::invalid_argument` -> 400).
- `web/app.js`: comment list rendering gained `data-comment-id`, an `(edited)` marker, and conditional
  Edit/Delete buttons (`canModerate = comment.author.id === state.principal?.userId ||
  state.principal?.isAdmin` -- a client-side simplification, not the security boundary, since the client
  never loads per-project role information anywhere else in the app either; the server enforces D83
  independently). Edit toggles an in-place textarea (Save sends `PATCH` with `expectedVersion:
  comment.version`; Cancel discards by re-fetching the issue). Delete sends `DELETE` and refreshes.
  `web/styles.css` gained `.comment-actions`/`.comment-edit-textarea`/`.comment-edit-actions`.

### Verification

1. `cmake --build` (full config, `-DTICKETHUB_BUILD_SERVER=ON`): zero warnings/errors from Ticket Hub's
   own files (Crow's headers still emit their own expected `-Wconversion` noise).
2. `ctest --output-on-failure`: 7/7 green, including new assertions in `sqlite_integration_tests`
   (`findCommentById`, `editComment` success/version-increment/`edited_at`-set/stale-conflict/
   unknown-returns-nullopt, `deleteComment` soft-delete/excluded-from-listing/not-found/no-op-on-repeat/
   row-still-physically-present) and `authorization_integration_tests` (non-author-non-admin Forbidden
   for edit and delete, self-edit succeeds, global-admin can edit/delete any comment, unknown-comment
   returns nullopt/false).
3. Re-ran the SQLite-only and PostgreSQL-only build configurations: both compile and pass cleanly.
4. Live PostgreSQL verification: a standalone smoke-test program (not committed) exercised
   `findCommentById`/`editComment`/`deleteComment` directly against `PostgresDatabase` and a local
   PostgreSQL server (created and dropped for this check), confirming the same behavior as the SQLite
   integration tests.
5. Standalone Playwright/Chromium script (same approach as every prior UI batch), against a locally
   running server, SQLite, demo-seeded: logged in as `demo`, added a comment, confirmed the Edit button
   is visible for the author's own comment, edited it and confirmed the new body and an `(edited)`
   marker appear, clicked Edit again and Cancel and confirmed the change was discarded, then deleted the
   comment and confirmed the comment count dropped by one. Logged out, logged in as `alex`, added a
   second comment; logged out, logged in as `sam` (neither the author nor a global admin), opened the
   same issue, and confirmed `sam` sees zero Edit buttons on `alex`'s comment (client-side hiding,
   backed by the server-side authorization tests above).
6. Re-ran every prior UI batch's browser test (login, hierarchy/resolution pickers, edit/links/clone/
   watch-vote, project management, both recycle bins, reorder/move/bulk actions) against the same build
   to confirm no regression -- all still pass unchanged.

All checks passed. No committed test scripts or screenshots (scratchpad only).

### What is still not built

The rest of Phase 4 remains unimplemented: the full Markdown editor/toolbar/preview (D16), fixed emoji
reactions on comments (D84), `@handle` mentions with autocomplete (D80, needs a new `users.handle`
column, D56), the fixed in-app notification set (D14), simplified worklogs (D13), and the append-only
admin/security audit log (D23). Phase 5 (attachments and the Kanban board) is untouched.

## 2026-07-31 — Reorder, move, and bulk-action UI: `web/` now covers every Phase 1-3 route

Added the last three missing pieces identified in `NEXT.md`: manual ordering (D31), moving an issue
between projects (D37), and simple bulk actions (D36). With this batch, every write route added across
Phases 1-3 has a reachable control somewhere in the demo UI.

### What changed

- `web/app.js`: `issueRows()` gained `orderable` (adds an Order column with move-up/move-down buttons,
  disabled at the ends) and `selectable` (adds a checkbox column) options. `renderIssuesView()` now sorts
  the fetched issues by `rankOrder` and passes `orderable: true` whenever exactly one project is selected
  (reordering is inherently project-scoped -- `reorderIssue`'s `beforeIssueKey` anchor must be in the same
  project); always passes `selectable: true` in the active (non-recycle-bin) view and renders a bulk-action
  bar that appears once at least one checkbox is checked.
- The issue drawer gained a "Move to project" control (target-project `<select>` + button, omitted
  entirely when there is nowhere else to move to) calling `POST /api/issues/{key}/move`; on success it
  reopens the drawer under the issue's new key.
- `deletedIssueRows()` (from the previous batch) is unaffected -- reorder/select only apply to the active
  view, matching that soft-deleted issues can't be reordered or bulk-acted-on anyway.

### A bug caught and fixed before it could surface in testing

The new checkboxes and move-up/move-down buttons render inside the same `<tr>` that `bindIssueLinks()`
already binds a click-to-open-drawer handler to (unchanged from every prior batch). Recognized during
implementation, before running the browser test, that clicking a checkbox or a reorder button would
therefore *also* open the issue drawer via the bubbled click event -- fixed proactively by calling
`event.stopPropagation()` in both the checkbox and the move-up/move-down click handlers, then confirmed
with an explicit assertion in the browser test (`drawer NOT opened by checkbox click: true`) rather than
just trusting the fix.

### Verification

Standalone Playwright/Chromium scripts (same approach as prior UI batches), against a locally running
server, SQLite, demo-seeded:

1. Filtering the Issues table to project `TH` shows an Order column; filtering back to "All projects"
   hides it (count 0).
2. Moving the second row up swaps it with the first row exactly (`[TH-2, TH-1, TH-3, ...]`); moving the
   (now-first) row back down restores the original order (`[TH-1, TH-2, TH-3, ...]`) -- confirms the
   move-up/move-down anchor math is correct in both directions, not just one.
3. Opening `TH-4`'s drawer shows the "Move to project" control; moving it to `WEB` reopens the drawer
   showing `WEB-3` (the newly allocated key).
4. The bulk-action bar is hidden with zero rows checked; checking two rows shows "2 selected" and does
   *not* open the drawer (the proactive fix, explicitly asserted); bulk-adding a label to both reports "2
   succeeded, 0 failed" as a toast.
5. Re-ran every prior UI batch's browser test (login, hierarchy/resolution pickers, edit/links/clone/
   watch-vote, project management, issue recycle bin) against the same build to confirm no regression --
   all five still pass unchanged.

All checks passed on the first full run (the checkbox/click-bubbling issue was caught by reasoning through
the DOM structure during implementation and fixed before ever running the test, not found by a failing
test). No committed test files or screenshots (scratchpad only).

### What is still not built

Nothing from the Phase 1-3 API surface is missing UI coverage anymore. `web/` still has no UI for
anything beyond that surface (e.g. no drag-and-drop on the Board, no keyboard-driven bulk selection) --
those were never part of the reduced-scope V1 target's write-route list, just possible UX refinements.

## 2026-07-31 — Issue recycle bin UI added

Added the symmetric counterpart to last batch's project recycle bin: a Delete action in the issue drawer
and a recycle-bin view in the Issues list, both gated the same way (global-administrator-only to view the
bin/restore/purge; project-Admin-or-above to soft-delete, matching D22's mirror of D88/D89).

### What changed

- `web/app.js`: a Delete button in the drawer's actions row (`DELETE /api/issues/{key}`); `renderIssues()`
  now delegates to `renderIssuesView(showingDeleted)` exactly mirroring `renderProjectsView`'s shape --
  active view keeps the existing filter bar, recycle-bin view replaces it with Restore/Delete-permanently
  buttons per row from `GET /api/issues/deleted`, and a toggle button visible only to global admins swaps
  between the two.
- Deleted-issue rows are deliberately not given a click-to-open-drawer handler, since a soft-deleted issue
  is excluded from ordinary `GET /api/issues/{key}` lookup (would 404).

### Verification

Standalone Playwright/Chromium scripts (same approach as prior UI batches), against a locally running
server, SQLite, demo-seeded:

1. As the global-admin `demo` user: deleting `TH-1` via the drawer's Delete button closes the drawer and
   removes the row from the active Issues table; the recycle-bin toggle shows it in the bin; Restore
   returns it to the active table; deleting it again and clicking Delete-permanently removes it from the
   bin entirely.
2. As `sam` (a TH project member, not a project admin): the recycle-bin toggle is entirely absent from the
   Issues view; attempting to delete `TH-2` via the drawer fails with the server's exact message ("Actor
   lacks the required role on project TH") shown as a toast, and the drawer stays open since the delete
   never actually happened -- confirming the client doesn't fake success or crash on a 403.
3. Re-ran all four prior UI batches' browser tests (login, hierarchy/resolution pickers, edit/links/clone/
   watch-vote, project management) against the same build to confirm no regression -- all still pass
   unchanged.

All checks passed on the first implementation attempt (after fixing one ambiguous test locator, not an
app bug -- an `h1` selector matched both the recycle-bin page heading and the still-in-DOM, merely hidden,
issue drawer's own `<h1>`). No committed test files or screenshots (scratchpad only).

### What is still not built

Bulk actions and reorder/move still have no UI in `web/` -- see `NEXT.md`.

## 2026-07-31 — Project-management UI added: create, archive, recycle bin

Added the next missing `web/` area: project lifecycle management. Previously the Projects view was purely
read-only (a grid of cards, click-to-open-board) with no way to create, archive, delete, restore, or
permanently purge a project from the UI at all.

### What changed

- `web/index.html`: a `#project-modal` (key/name/description) matching the create-issue modal's pattern.
- `web/app.js`: `renderProjects()` now delegates to `renderProjectsView(showingDeleted)`, which renders
  either the active project grid (with Archive/Unarchive and Delete buttons per card, plus a "New project"
  button, plus a "Recycle bin" toggle visible only to global administrators) or the recycle bin (Restore
  and Delete-permanently buttons per card, fetched from `GET /api/projects/deleted`). `renderCurrentView()`
  now awaits `renderProjects()` (previously fire-and-forget).
- Generalized the modal-close (`[data-close-modal]`) wiring to close whichever `.modal-backdrop` ancestor
  the clicked button belongs to, instead of being hardcoded to the create-issue modal only, so the new
  project modal's own close button works without duplicating logic.

### A real bug caught by this batch's own browser testing (not project-management-specific)

Testing "does a non-admin see the recycle-bin toggle" required logging out of the global-admin demo
account and into a non-admin one (`sam`) within the same page. After that switch, the app hung
indefinitely on a loading spinner instead of showing sam's dashboard. Network tracing (`page.on('request'
/'response')`) showed the login itself succeeded (`/api/auth/me` returned 200 for sam), but the very next
call was `GET /api/projects` followed by nothing -- no `/api/dashboard` call at all. The cause: `state`
(including `state.view`) is a single module-level object that was never reset on logout, so it still held
`'projects'` from the demo session; `renderCurrentView()` correctly rendered the Projects view for sam
(not a bug in that function), but the test's assumption that any fresh login lands on the dashboard was
false -- and, more importantly, this is a genuine product issue for a shared browser tab: a second user
could land on a project they don't have access to, or one already archived/deleted by the first user.
Fixed by having `showLoginScreen()` (used for both explicit logout and session-expiry) reset all of
`state` via a new shared `initialState()` function, not just clear `state.principal`.

### Verification

Standalone Playwright/Chromium scripts (same approach as prior UI batches), against a locally running
server, SQLite, demo-seeded, as the global-admin `demo` user unless noted:

1. Created project `QA`; card appears in the grid immediately.
2. Attempted a duplicate key (`qa` again); inline error shows the server's exact message ("Project key is
   already in use: QA").
3. Archived `QA`; it drops out of both the active project grid and the sidebar's project shortcuts (D87:
   archiving is not a soft-delete, but it does leave the active-projects view).
4. Created `QA2`, deleted it (moved to recycle bin), toggled to the recycle-bin view (found there),
   restored it (gone from the bin), toggled back to active (found there again), deleted it again, toggled
   to the recycle bin, permanently deleted it (gone from the bin for good).
5. Logged out and into `sam` (a non-admin): the recycle-bin toggle is absent entirely (not just
   disabled); attempting to create a project produces an inline 403 ("This action requires global
   administrator privileges") without ever creating anything -- confirming the client defers entirely to
   the server's authorization check rather than second-guessing it.
6. Re-ran the login and hierarchy/resolution-picker browser tests from the two prior batches to confirm no
   regression from the `state` reset change -- both still pass unchanged.

All checks passed after the state-reset fix; no committed test files or screenshots (scratchpad only).

### What is still not built

The issue recycle bin, bulk actions, and reorder/move still have no UI in `web/` -- see `NEXT.md`.

## 2026-07-31 — Full edit, clone, links, and watch/vote UI added to the issue drawer

Added the next slice of `web/` UI identified as missing: everything the issue drawer could reach through
the API but had no controls for -- full edit, clone, links (list/add/delete), and watch/vote.

### What changed

- `web/app.js`: `openIssue()` now fetches links/watchers/voters alongside the issue/comments (5 parallel
  requests instead of 2), and its rendering was restructured into an inner `render(editing)` closure so
  the same fetched data can re-render in read or edit mode without a refetch. Added `editFieldsMarkup()`
  (the edit-mode field set), a drawer actions row (Watch/Vote toggle buttons with live counts, Clone,
  Edit), a Links section (list with bidirectional outward/inward labels, add form, delete buttons), and a
  Parent meta row (clickable, when set).
- `web/styles.css`: `.drawer-actions`, `.link-list`/`.link-row`/`.link-form` styles.

### Two real bugs caught by this batch's own browser testing

1. **Layout bug**: `.link-list` is a CSS grid container; grid items get an implicit content-based minimum
   width unless overridden, so `.link-row` refused to shrink below its own intrinsic content width and
   visually overflowed into the drawer's meta sidebar column -- Playwright's click-action safety check
   ("element intercepts pointer events") caught this directly, refusing to click a delete-link button that
   was actually covered by the sidebar. Confirmed via `getBoundingClientRect()`: before the fix the link
   row's right edge sat at x=1090.8 while the sidebar's left edge was at x=1036 (an ~82px real overlap
   region); after adding `min-width: 0` to `.link-row`, the row's right edge moved to x=1008, clear of the
   sidebar. This was a genuine bug a real user would have hit too, not a test artifact.
2. **Test-script bug, not an app bug, but worth recording**: an earlier version of the browser test used
   an ambiguous `.link-row` selector and picked up the automatic `clones` link (created by the earlier
   Clone action, per D60) instead of the manually-added `relates_to` link, making it look like the "add
   link" feature wasn't working. Rewritten to scope the assertion to the row matching the intended link
   label, which confirmed the feature was correct all along.

### Verification

Standalone Playwright/Chromium scripts (same approach as prior UI batches), against a locally running
server, SQLite, demo-seeded:

1. Watch toggle: "☆ Watch (0)" → click → "★ Watching (1)" → click again → back to "☆ Watch (0)". Vote
   toggle: same pattern independently.
2. Clone: clicking Clone on TH-1 navigates the drawer to the new cloned issue (a fresh key), whose Links
   section already shows the automatic `clones` link back to TH-1 (D60) without any extra action.
3. Links: starting from 1 link row (the automatic clone link), adding a `relates_to` link to TH-2 brings
   the count to 2; the new row shows TH-2's actual summary and is clickable, navigating the drawer to
   TH-2; from TH-2's own drawer the same link appears (bidirectional) and its delete button works,
   bringing TH-2's link count back to 0.
4. Full edit: opening Edit on TH-1 shows editable fields pre-filled with current values; changing
   summary/description/priority/assignee/story points/labels and clicking Save persists correctly (the
   drawer re-renders in read mode showing the new values, `edit-error` stays hidden); opening Edit again,
   changing the summary, and clicking Cancel discards the change (the drawer shows the previously-saved
   summary, not the discarded one).
5. Re-ran the login and hierarchy/resolution-picker browser tests from the two prior batches against the
   same build to confirm no regression -- both still pass unchanged.

All checks passed after the layout fix; no committed test files or screenshots (scratchpad only).

### What is still not built

Project-management UI (create/archive/recycle-bin), the issue recycle bin, bulk actions, and reorder/move
still have no UI in `web/` -- see `NEXT.md`.

## 2026-07-31 — Resolution picker and Epic/parent picker added to the demo UI

Fixed two broken UI paths identified while planning the next batch of `web/` work: completing an issue
via the drawer's status `<select>` always 422'd (no `resolution` was ever sent), and the create-issue
modal had no field for `parentIssueKey` at all (and was even missing "Sub-task" from the issue-type
list), so a Sub-task could never be created from the UI and a Story/Task/Bug could never be linked to an
Epic from the UI.

### What changed

- `web/app.js`: `RESOLUTIONS` catalog and `resolutionLabel()`; `issueTypeHierarchyLevel()` (mirrors
  `Domain::issueTypeHierarchyLevel` for client-side picker narrowing only -- the server remains the actual
  source of truth); `applyStatusChange()` helper; `refreshCreateParentOptions()` which fetches the
  selected project's issues and filters them by hierarchy level to populate the Epic/parent picker.
- `web/index.html`: added `sub-task` to the create-issue-type `<select>`; added the Epic/parent `<select>`
  (`#create-parent`), hidden/shown and relabeled based on the selected issue type.
- `web/app.js` (drawer): the status `<select>`'s change handler now checks the target status's category;
  for a Done-category target it reveals an inline resolution row (select + Confirm/Cancel) instead of
  calling the API immediately; Confirm calls `applyStatusChange` with the chosen resolution. The drawer
  also now displays the issue's resolution (once set, read-only) and its parent issue key (once linked,
  clickable -- scoped with a dedicated `#drawer-parent-link` id and a single listener, deliberately
  *not* reusing the page-wide `bindIssueLinks()` helper, which would have re-registered duplicate click
  listeners on every background view element still mounted behind the drawer).
- `web/styles.css`: small additions for the resolution `<select>` and its Confirm/Cancel button row.

### A real bug caught during this batch's own browser testing

The project (`#create-project`) and issue-type (`#create-issue-type`) `<select>` elements both trigger
`refreshCreateParentOptions()` on `change`. A Playwright test that selected project then issue type in
quick succession (`page.selectOption` twice with no wait between) produced a duplicated Epic entry in the
picker -- two in-flight async calls interleaved: the first call's fetch resolved and appended options
*after* the second call had already reset and re-populated the list. Fixed with a monotonically
increasing request-id guard (`createParentRequestId`) that makes a call's `select.innerHTML +=` a no-op
once a newer call has started, so only the most recent selection's results ever get applied. The fix was
verified by re-running the same test and confirming exactly one option per matching issue.

### Verification

Standalone Playwright/Chromium scripts (same approach as the login-screen batch) against a locally running
server, SQLite, demo-seeded:

1. Selecting "Epic" as the issue type hides the Epic/parent picker entirely (an Epic cannot have a
   parent, D64); created an Epic issue successfully.
2. Selecting "Story" shows "Epic (optional)" and the picker's options include the just-created Epic
   (exactly once, confirming the race-condition fix); created a Story with that Epic as parent; the
   drawer showed a "Parent" row linking to the Epic; clicking it navigated to the Epic's own drawer.
3. Selecting "Sub-task" shows "Parent (required)"; submitting without picking one produced the server's
   exact validation message (`A sub-task must have a parent issue`) inline in the create-error banner,
   confirming the client correctly defers to server-side validation rather than duplicating it.
4. Created a fresh Task issue, then selected "Done" in the drawer's status picker: the resolution row was
   hidden before the selection and visible after; picking "Fixed" and clicking Confirm applied the status
   change with the resolution, which then displayed read-only in the drawer's Resolution row.
5. Reopening that same issue (selecting a non-Done status) cleared the resolution (server-side, D68-D70)
   and hid the resolution row again for that direction, with no picker shown (resolution is only required
   moving *into* a Done-category status, never out of one).

All checks passed after the request-id fix; no committed test files or screenshots (scratchpad only, per
the established pattern from the login-screen batch).

### What is still not built

Full edit, links, clone, watch/vote, the issue recycle bin, bulk actions, reorder/move, and
project-management UI still don't exist in `web/` -- see `NEXT.md`.

## 2026-07-31 — Minimal login screen added to the demo UI, verified with a real headless browser

Added a login screen to `web/index.html`/`app.js`/`styles.css` (the "Immediate next step" identified in
the previous entry below): the demo UI previously had no authentication flow at all, so `TicketService`'s
project-role enforcement, verified live via `curl` in the previous entry, was still unreachable from the
UI itself, and the CSRF-token attachment the UI's own `fetch` calls needed was entirely missing.

### What changed

- `web/index.html`: a `#login-screen` (email/password form) sibling to the existing `#app-shell`, both
  toggled via a shared `.hidden` class; the sidebar footer now shows the signed-in user's initials/name/
  email (previously a hardcoded "Demo User") plus a sign-out button.
- `web/app.js`: `api()` now reads the `th_csrf` cookie and attaches it as `X-CSRF-Token` on every
  non-`GET` request (previously never sent from the UI at all -- every write from the demo UI would have
  403'd the moment CSRF enforcement went live); any `401` response from any API call (except the two auth
  probes themselves) shows the login screen, handling a session expiring mid-use; `init()` now silently
  probes `GET /api/auth/me` before doing anything else and shows the login screen instead of loading data
  if that fails; the login form calls `POST /api/auth/login`, then re-probes `/api/auth/me` to populate
  the sidebar footer; the sign-out button calls `POST /api/auth/logout` and returns to the login screen.
- `web/styles.css`: a centered login card matching the existing design system (same input/button/
  form-error styles as the create-issue modal).

### Verification

Standalone Node.js scripts driving Playwright against the pre-installed Chromium
(`executablePath: '/opt/pw-browsers/chromium'`, `playwright-core` installed ad hoc into the scratchpad
directory, not committed to the repository) against a locally running `ticket-hub` server
(SQLite, auto-migrated, demo-seeded):

1. Fresh page load: `#login-screen` visible, `#app-shell` hidden, zero cookies present.
2. Submitting valid credentials (`demo@ticket-hub.local` / `demo12345`): both `th_session` (`Secure`,
   confirmed via `page.context().cookies()`) and `th_csrf` cookies get set: `#app-shell` becomes visible,
   `#login-screen` hides, and the sidebar footer shows "Demo User" -- confirming `Secure` cookies are
   **not** a blocker for local testing, since Chromium (and other major browsers) treat `localhost`/
   `127.0.0.1` as a "potentially trustworthy origin" exempt from the Secure-requires-HTTPS restriction;
   this does not weaken the production security posture (a real deployment hostname still requires TLS
   for the cookie to be set at all).
3. Every existing view renders after login: dashboard (stat cards populated), issues list (table rows),
   board (Kanban columns), projects (project cards) -- all previously untestable end-to-end because
   nothing could authenticate.
4. Created a new issue via the create-issue modal (`POST /api/issues`, a CSRF-protected write) through the
   browser's own `fetch` -- succeeded, opened the issue drawer, no error shown. This is the first time a
   CSRF-protected write from the *browser UI itself* (not `curl` with a manually-added header) was
   confirmed to work, proving `app.js`'s new automatic CSRF-header attachment functions correctly.
5. Changed the new issue's status via the drawer's status `<select>` (`PATCH .../status`, also
   CSRF-protected) -- succeeded, confirmation toast shown.
6. Clicked sign-out: both cookies cleared, `#login-screen` shown again. Reloaded the page afterward: still
   on the login screen (not silently re-entering the app), confirming the server actually invalidated the
   session rather than the UI merely hiding it client-side.
7. Submitted a wrong password: inline error message shown ("Invalid email or password"), `#app-shell`
   never becomes visible.

All seven checks passed on the first attempt; no code changes were needed after the initial
implementation. Screenshots were captured for visual sanity-check (login screen and post-login dashboard)
and discarded after review (not committed -- generated artifacts, not source).

### What is still not built

Only the login screen exists. There is still no UI for project management (create/archive/recycle-bin),
issue hierarchy/resolution pickers, full edit, links, clone, watch/vote, the issue recycle bin, bulk
actions, or the reorder/move actions added earlier this session -- all of those remain reachable only via
direct API calls (all live-verified via `curl`, see the entry below), not through the demo UI. See
`NEXT.md` for the itemized list.

## 2026-07-31 — Server target verified end-to-end for the first time (Crow build succeeded)

Every prior entry in this log recorded the same standing limitation: outbound access to `github.com` was
blocked, so the Crow-based `ticket-hub` server target had never been compiled, and every Phase 1-3 route
in `src/web/Api.cpp` was written blind against established patterns. That changed this session: network
access to `github.com` is now reachable from the sandbox, so the server target was built and exercised
against a live HTTP server for the first time.

### What changed in the environment

- `git ls-remote https://github.com/CrowCpp/Crow.git` succeeds; CMake's `FetchContent_Declare`/
  `FetchContent_MakeAvailable(Crow)` fetches Crow 1.3.3 successfully.
- Crow 1.3.3's `CMakeLists.txt` additionally requires standalone `asio` (not Boost.Asio), which was not
  preinstalled. Installed via `sudo apt-get install -y libasio-dev` (already listed as a dependency in
  `README.md`'s "Requirements"/apt install line, so no doc change was needed there) — this pulled in
  `libboost-dev` and related packages as transitive dependencies of the Ubuntu package, not because
  Ticket Hub itself needs Boost.

### Build

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DTICKETHUB_BUILD_SERVER=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build --parallel "$(nproc)"
```

Configured and built clean on the first attempt after `libasio-dev` was installed. `-Wall -Wextra
-Wpedantic -Wconversion -Wshadow` surfaces a large number of warnings **from Crow's own headers**
(`mustache.h`, `routing.h`, `http_server.h`, `http_connection.h`, `parser.h` — mostly `-Wconversion` on
`size_t`/`uint64_t` narrowing in Crow's implementation) — expected third-party noise, not addressable in
this repository. Isolating just `src/main.cpp`, `src/web/Api.cpp`, and `src/web/HttpServer.cpp` (the only
files this repository owns that only compile when `TICKETHUB_BUILD_SERVER=ON`) confirms **zero warnings
and zero errors from Ticket Hub's own code** — every route added across Phases 1-3, blind against
established patterns for months of prior batches, compiled correctly the first time it was actually
type-checked. `ctest --output-on-failure` is still 7/7 with the server target also built.

### Live HTTP smoke test

Launched the built `ticket-hub` binary against a fresh SQLite database (`TICKETHUB_AUTO_MIGRATE=true
TICKETHUB_SEED_DEMO=true`, bound to `127.0.0.1:18080`) and drove it with `curl`, covering essentially
every route in the "Prototype API" table in `README.md`:

- `GET /api/health` — 200, correct backend/version.
- `POST /api/auth/login` (demo, alex) — 200, `Set-Cookie` for both `th_session` (HttpOnly) and `th_csrf`
  (readable) as designed; `GET /api/auth/me` reflects the session; `POST /api/auth/logout` then
  `GET /api/auth/me` — 401, confirming the session is actually gone, not just cookie-cleared client-side.
- CSRF enforcement: `POST /api/issues` without `X-CSRF-Token` — 403; with a valid token — 201.
- Project-role enforcement: Sam (TH member, not a WEB member) creating a WEB issue — 403; Alex (not a
  global admin) creating a project — 403; the global admin — 201.
- Fixed workflow rules: completing a fresh issue without `resolution` — 422; with a valid `resolution` —
  200, `resolution` and incremented `version` present in the response; a stale `expectedVersion` — 409.
  (An earlier pass in this same sweep initially targeted `TH-1`, which the demo seed already has in
  `done` status — that call correctly returned 200/no-op rather than 422, which is the documented
  "resolution is ignored when the status does not actually change" behavior, not a bug; re-ran against a
  freshly created issue to actually exercise the required-resolution path.)
- **`POST /api/issues/{key}/reorder`** (D31, this session's most recent batch): reordering an issue
  before another renumbers both correctly (`rankOrder` reflects the new order on `GET`).
- **`POST /api/issues/{key}/move`** (D37, this session's most recent batch): moving `TH-7` into `WEB`
  returns the issue with `projectKey: "WEB"`, `key: "WEB-3"`; `GET /api/issues/TH-7` (the vacated key)
  still resolves to the same issue via the `issue_key_aliases` alias written by `moveIssue` — confirming
  the alias mechanism works through the real HTTP/JSON layer, not just the database layer directly.
- Full-replacement issue edit (`PATCH /api/issues/{key}`), cloning (`POST .../clone`), issue links
  (`POST`/`GET .../links`, `DELETE /api/issue-links/{id}`), watching/voting and their unwatch/unvote/list
  counterparts, the issue recycle bin (`DELETE`/`POST .../restore`/`DELETE .../permanent`,
  `GET /api/issues/deleted`), all four bulk actions (`POST /api/issues/bulk/{status,assign,label,delete}`
  — confirmed `succeeded`/`failed` key lists), comments (`POST`/`GET .../comments`), the full project
  lifecycle (`POST /api/projects`, `PATCH .../archived`, `DELETE`/`POST .../restore`/
  `DELETE .../permanent`, `GET /api/projects/deleted`), and the anonymous-read-access toggle
  (`GET`/`PUT /api/settings/anonymous-read`, confirmed `GET /api/projects` goes 401 → 200 as the toggle
  flips, and that only a global admin may flip it) — every one exercised live, every one behaved exactly
  as documented in `README.md`'s "Prototype API" section. **Zero bugs found** in `Api.cpp` across this
  entire sweep.
- The scratch SQLite database, server process, and all temporary cookie-jar files were removed after the
  sweep; nothing from this verification was committed.

### What is still not verified

There is still no login page or any authentication UI in `web/` — the demo UI browses/creates issues
without ever calling `/api/auth/login`, so it will start failing 401s against a real deployment where
session enforcement is live end-to-end, exactly as `README.md` already notes. Building a minimal login
page (and ideally project-management/hierarchy/reorder/move UI) is the next real gap, not a verification
gap — see `NEXT.md`.

## 2026-07-31 — Phase 3 complete at the core/CLI/test layer (manual ordering and moving between projects, reduced scope)

Verified in the same session/environment as the batches below: GCC 13.3.0, CMake 3.28.3, SQLite 3.45.1,
libpq 16.14, and a live local PostgreSQL 16.14 server (restarted first, as in every prior batch this
session; freshly created scratch database/role, dropped afterward).

### Core configuration

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DTICKETHUB_BUILD_SERVER=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build --parallel "$(nproc)"
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

New `IDatabase::reorderIssue`/`moveIssue` methods in both adapters, plus `TicketService::reorderIssue`/
`moveIssue`, compiled cleanly. Also verified the SQLite-only (`-DTICKETHUB_WITH_POSTGRES=OFF`) and
PostgreSQL-only (`-DTICKETHUB_WITH_SQLITE=OFF`) configurations build clean, both with
`-DTICKETHUB_BUILD_SERVER=OFF`.

A migration bug was caught during this batch and fixed before it reached a committed test failure: the
`007_ranking.sql` backfill (`UPDATE issues SET rank_order = issue_number`) only reaches rows that exist at
migration-apply time, but `002_seed_demo.sql` is applied through a separate, non-checksummed code path
(`discoverMigrationFiles` excludes `_seed_` filenames from the ordered migration run) that in practice
runs *after* `migrate()` completes -- so every seeded issue was getting the column's `DEFAULT 0` instead
of a real rank. Fixed by setting `rank_order` explicitly in the seed `INSERT` (both backends) rather than
relying on the migration backfill for seed data.

### Passing tests (7/7 — same binaries, extended coverage)

1. `ticket-hub-domain-tests`, `ticket-hub-migration-tests`, `ticket-hub-identity-tests`,
   `ticket-hub-workflow-tests`, `ticket-hub-crypto-tests` — unchanged, all still passing.
2. `ticket-hub-sqlite-integration-tests` — extended: reordering TH-3 before TH-1 renumbers the whole
   project so TH-3 ranks lower than TH-1; reordering TH-3 with no anchor appends it to the end (ranks
   higher than every other TH issue); reordering relative to an issue in a different project and
   reordering an issue before itself are both rejected; moving TH-2 into WEB allocates `WEB-3`, appends
   its rank after WEB's existing issues, and the vacated `TH-2` key resolves via `issue_key_aliases` back
   to `WEB-3`, with one `issue_history` row (`field_name = 'project'`); moving to the issue's own project,
   to an unknown project, an issue that has children, and an issue that has a parent are all rejected.
3. `ticket-hub-authorization-tests` — extended: a non-member cannot reorder another project's issue; a TH
   member can reorder a TH issue; moving an issue requires project-Member-or-above on **both** the source
   and target projects -- a TH member who is not a WEB member is rejected moving either direction, while a
   member of both (TH member, WEB admin) succeeds.

### Additional verification beyond the automated suite

- **Live PostgreSQL 16 server**: ran a standalone program (`pg_rank_move_smoke.cpp`, not committed)
  against `PostgresDatabase` directly, covering the same renumbering, cross-project-anchor-rejection,
  move/alias/history, same-project-rejection, and parent/children-rejection cases as the SQLite test. All
  assertions passed. The scratch database and role were dropped after verification.
- Both SQLite and PostgreSQL adapters, `ticket-hub-core`, `ticket-hub-cli`, and all seven test binaries
  compile and link cleanly, including in the SQLite-only and PostgreSQL-only build configurations.

### Environment limitations (unchanged)

`src/web/Api.cpp`, `src/web/HttpServer.cpp`, and `src/main.cpp` (the `ticket-hub` server target) still
could not be compiled -- outbound access to `github.com` remains blocked. The new
`POST /api/issues/{key}/reorder` and `POST /api/issues/{key}/move` routes, and the new `rankOrder` field
on the issue JSON representation, follow the same patterns as the already-unverified Phase 1-3 routes and
carry the same caveat.

## 2026-07-31 — Phase 3, partial continued (issue recycle bin and bulk actions, reduced scope)

Verified in the same session/environment as the batches below: GCC 13.3.0, CMake 3.28.3, SQLite 3.45.1,
libpq 16.14, and a live local PostgreSQL 16.14 server (the server needed restarting first, as in every
prior batch this session; freshly created scratch database/role, dropped afterward).

### Core configuration

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DTICKETHUB_BUILD_SERVER=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build --parallel 4
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

All warnings enabled (`-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Wconversion -Wshadow`); zero warnings, including through
the four new `IDatabase` methods (`softDeleteIssue`/`restoreIssue`/`listDeletedIssues`/
`permanentlyDeleteIssue`) forcing a rebuild through both adapters and `TicketService`. Bulk actions added
no new `IDatabase` methods at all -- they compose the existing single-issue operations.

### Passing tests (7/7 — same binaries, extended coverage)

1. `ticket-hub-domain-tests`, `ticket-hub-migration-tests`, `ticket-hub-identity-tests`,
   `ticket-hub-workflow-tests`, `ticket-hub-crypto-tests` — unchanged, all still passing.
2. `ticket-hub-sqlite-integration-tests` — extended: soft-deletes the previously-created issue, asserts
   it disappears from ordinary lookup, asserts soft-deleting it again is a no-op, asserts it appears in
   `listDeletedIssues`, asserts it can be restored and found again, re-deletes it, permanently deletes
   it, asserts a repeat permanent delete returns `false`, and asserts its comments are gone from the
   `comments` table afterward (direct `COUNT(*)` query, confirming the `ON DELETE CASCADE` foreign key
   actually fires, not just that the issue itself can no longer be looked up).
3. `ticket-hub-authorization-tests` — extended: a non-member cannot soft-delete an issue; a project admin
   (not global admin) can; listing/restoring/permanently-deleting are rejected for the project admin and
   permitted for the global administrator, mirroring the project recycle bin's D88 split exactly. Bulk
   actions: `bulkAssign` on a mixed batch of two accessible TH issues, one inaccessible WEB issue, and one
   unknown key reports 2 succeeded / 2 failed; `bulkAddLabel` and `bulkChangeStatus` succeed for an
   accessible batch; `bulkDelete` soft-deletes a batch and the deleted issues are confirmed gone from
   ordinary lookup afterward.

### Additional verification beyond the automated suite

- **Live PostgreSQL 16 server**: ran `ticket-hub-cli migrate`/`seed-demo`, then compiled and ran a
  standalone program (`pg_recycle_bulk_smoke.cpp`, not committed) exercising `PostgresDatabase::
  softDeleteIssue`/`restoreIssue`/`listDeletedIssues`/`permanentlyDeleteIssue` directly, then wrapping
  the same `PostgresDatabase` in a `TicketService` to exercise `bulkAssign` (including the unknown-key
  partial-failure case), `bulkAddLabel`, `bulkChangeStatus`, and `bulkDelete`. All 15 assertions passed.
  The scratch database and role were dropped after verification.
- Both SQLite and PostgreSQL adapters, `ticket-hub-core`, `ticket-hub-cli`, and all seven test binaries
  compile and link cleanly, including in the SQLite-only and PostgreSQL-only build configurations.

### Environment limitations (unchanged)

`src/web/Api.cpp`, `src/web/HttpServer.cpp`, and `src/main.cpp` (the `ticket-hub` server target) still
could not be compiled -- outbound access to `github.com` remains blocked. The new
`DELETE /api/issues/{key}`, `GET /api/issues/deleted`, `POST /api/issues/{key}/restore`,
`DELETE /api/issues/{key}/permanent`, and `POST /api/issues/bulk/{status,assign,label,delete}` routes
follow the same patterns as the already-unverified Phase 1-3 routes and carry the same caveat.

## 2026-07-31 — Phase 3, partial continued (watchers and voting, reduced scope)

Verified in the same session/environment as the batches below: GCC 13.3.0, CMake 3.28.3, SQLite 3.45.1,
libpq 16.14, and a live local PostgreSQL 16.14 server (the server needed restarting first, as in every
prior batch this session; freshly created scratch database/role, dropped afterward).

### Core configuration

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DTICKETHUB_BUILD_SERVER=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build --parallel 4
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

All warnings enabled (`-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Wconversion -Wshadow`); zero warnings, including through
the six new `IDatabase` methods (`watchIssue`/`unwatchIssue`/`listWatchers`/`voteIssue`/`unvoteIssue`/
`listVoters`) forcing a rebuild through both adapters and `TicketService`.

### Passing tests (7/7 — same binaries, extended coverage)

1. `ticket-hub-domain-tests`, `ticket-hub-migration-tests`, `ticket-hub-identity-tests`,
   `ticket-hub-workflow-tests`, `ticket-hub-crypto-tests` — unchanged, all still passing.
2. `ticket-hub-sqlite-integration-tests` — extended: watches the previously-created issue with two
   different users, asserts watching again is a no-op, asserts both watchers are listed, asserts
   unwatching removes one and unwatching again is a no-op; the same sequence for voting; asserts
   watching an unknown issue key raises `std::invalid_argument`.
3. `ticket-hub-authorization-tests` — extended: Sam, who is not a member of the WEB project at all
   (unlike every other actor/action tested in this file), can still watch and vote on a WEB issue,
   confirming watch/vote are deliberately exempt from the project-role check every other issue write
   enforces; watching/voting again is a no-op; both are visible to any authenticated reader.

### Additional verification beyond the automated suite

- **Live PostgreSQL 16 server**: ran `ticket-hub-cli migrate`/`seed-demo` (confirmed `issue_watchers`
  and `issue_votes` were created with the expected columns, composite primary key, and `ON DELETE
  CASCADE` foreign keys via `psql \d`), then compiled and ran a standalone program
  (`pg_watch_vote_smoke.cpp`, not committed) exercising `PostgresDatabase::watchIssue`/`unwatchIssue`/
  `listWatchers`/`voteIssue`/`unvoteIssue`/`listVoters` directly: idempotency of watch/vote, two
  independent watchers, listing, unwatch/unvote removing exactly the right row, and voting on an unknown
  issue key raising `std::invalid_argument`. All 13 assertions passed. The scratch database and role
  were dropped after verification.
- Both SQLite and PostgreSQL adapters, `ticket-hub-core`, `ticket-hub-cli`, and all seven test binaries
  compile and link cleanly, including in the SQLite-only and PostgreSQL-only build configurations.

### Environment limitations (unchanged)

`src/web/Api.cpp`, `src/web/HttpServer.cpp`, and `src/main.cpp` (the `ticket-hub` server target) still
could not be compiled -- outbound access to `github.com` remains blocked. The new
`POST`/`DELETE /api/issues/{key}/watch`, `GET /api/issues/{key}/watchers`,
`POST`/`DELETE /api/issues/{key}/vote`, and `GET /api/issues/{key}/voters` routes follow the same
patterns as the already-unverified Phase 1-3 routes and carry the same caveat.

## 2026-07-31 — Phase 3, partial continued (issue links and cloning, reduced scope)

Verified in the same session/environment as the batches below: GCC 13.3.0, CMake 3.28.3, SQLite 3.45.1,
libpq 16.14, and a live local PostgreSQL 16.14 server (freshly created for this batch and dropped
afterward, same as every prior PostgreSQL verification this session).

### Core configuration

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DTICKETHUB_BUILD_SERVER=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build --parallel 4
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

All warnings enabled (`-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Wconversion -Wshadow`); zero warnings, including through
the four new `IDatabase` methods (`createIssueLink`/`listIssueLinks`/`findIssueLinkById`/
`deleteIssueLink`) forcing a rebuild through both adapters and `TicketService`.

### Passing tests (7/7 — same binaries, extended coverage)

1. `ticket-hub-domain-tests`, `ticket-hub-migration-tests`, `ticket-hub-identity-tests`,
   `ticket-hub-crypto-tests` — unchanged, all still passing.
2. `ticket-hub-sqlite-integration-tests` — extended: creates a link from the previously-created issue to
   a seeded one, asserts it is visible as outward from the source and inward from the target, asserts an
   exact-duplicate link and a self-link are both rejected (the self-link by the database `CHECK`
   constraint), asserts `findIssueLinkById` resolves both ends, and asserts the link can be deleted
   (and that deleting it again returns `false`).
3. `ticket-hub-workflow-tests` — extended: clones an issue and asserts summary/description/type/
   priority/labels are copied but assignee and the parent/Epic link are not; asserts the clone has an
   outward `clones` link to the original and the original has the inverse inward link; clones a Sub-task
   and asserts its original parent is retained (the structural exception); and a basic link
   create/list/delete lifecycle through `TicketService`, including rejecting a self-link and an unknown
   link type.
4. `ticket-hub-authorization-tests` — extended: a non-member cannot clone another project's issue; a
   project admin can; creating a link between a project the actor can access and one they cannot is
   rejected even though the source project is fine; a non-member of either linked project cannot delete
   the link; a member of both can.

### Additional verification beyond the automated suite

- **Live PostgreSQL 16 server**: created a scratch `tickethub` database/role, ran `ticket-hub-cli
  migrate`/`seed-demo`, then compiled and ran a standalone program (`pg_links_smoke.cpp`, not committed)
  exercising both the raw `PostgresDatabase` link methods (create/list-from-both-ends/duplicate-and-
  self-link rejection/find-by-id/delete) and, through a `TicketService` wrapping the same
  `PostgresDatabase`, `cloneIssue` (field-copy correctness, the automatic `clones` link, and the
  sub-task-parent-retention special case). All 13 assertions passed. The scratch database and role were
  dropped after verification.
- Both SQLite and PostgreSQL adapters, `ticket-hub-core`, `ticket-hub-cli`, and all seven test binaries
  compile and link cleanly, including in the SQLite-only and PostgreSQL-only build configurations.

### Environment limitations (unchanged)

`src/web/Api.cpp`, `src/web/HttpServer.cpp`, and `src/main.cpp` (the `ticket-hub` server target) still
could not be compiled -- outbound access to `github.com` remains blocked. The new
`POST /api/issues/{key}/clone`, `GET`/`POST /api/issues/{key}/links`, and
`DELETE /api/issue-links/{id}` routes follow the same patterns as the already-unverified Phase 1-3
routes and carry the same caveat.

## 2026-07-31 — Phase 3, partial continued (full issue edit, reduced scope)

Verified in the same session/environment as the batches below: GCC 13.3.0, CMake 3.28.3, SQLite 3.45.1,
libpq 16.14, and a live local PostgreSQL 16.14 server (freshly created for this batch and dropped
afterward, same as every prior PostgreSQL verification this session).

### Core configuration

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DTICKETHUB_BUILD_SERVER=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build --parallel 4
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

All warnings enabled (`-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Wconversion -Wshadow`); zero warnings through the
`IDatabase::editIssue` addition (interface change forced a rebuild through `TicketService` and both
adapters, same discipline as the `changeIssueStatus` signature change in the prior batch).

### Passing tests (7/7 — same binaries, extended coverage)

1. `ticket-hub-domain-tests`, `ticket-hub-migration-tests`, `ticket-hub-identity-tests`,
   `ticket-hub-workflow-tests`, `ticket-hub-crypto-tests` — unchanged, all still passing.
2. `ticket-hub-sqlite-integration-tests` — extended: edits every standard field on the previously-created
   issue (summary, description, priority, assignee, story points, due date, labels), asserts the
   optimistic-lock version increments and the resolution set by the earlier status-change test is left
   undisturbed, asserts a stale-version edit raises `Domain::ConcurrencyConflict`, asserts the assignee
   can be cleared, and asserts at least six `issue_history` rows were written (one per changed field).
3. `ticket-hub-authorization-tests` — extended: a non-member cannot edit another project's issue
   (`Domain::Forbidden`); a project member can edit a project issue; editing an unknown issue key returns
   `std::nullopt` rather than throwing.

### Additional verification beyond the automated suite

- **Live PostgreSQL 16 server**: created a scratch `tickethub` database/role (the server needed
  restarting first, as in the prior batch), ran `ticket-hub-cli migrate`/`seed-demo`, then compiled and
  ran a standalone program (`pg_edit_smoke.cpp`, not committed) linking directly against
  `PostgresDatabase`: created an issue, edited every field (summary, description, priority, assignee,
  story points, due date, labels) and confirmed each was persisted and the version incremented, confirmed
  a stale-version edit raises `ConcurrencyConflict`, confirmed the assignee can be cleared, and confirmed
  editing an unknown issue key returns `std::nullopt`. All 11 assertions passed. The scratch database and
  role were dropped after verification.
- Both SQLite and PostgreSQL adapters, `ticket-hub-core`, `ticket-hub-cli`, and all seven test binaries
  compile and link cleanly, including in the SQLite-only and PostgreSQL-only build configurations.

### Environment limitations (unchanged)

`src/web/Api.cpp`, `src/web/HttpServer.cpp`, and `src/main.cpp` (the `ticket-hub` server target) still
could not be compiled -- outbound access to `github.com` remains blocked. The new
`PATCH /api/issues/{key}` full-edit route follows the same patterns as the already-unverified Phase 1-3
routes and carries the same caveat. While adding it, three existing routes (`POST /api/issues`,
`PATCH /api/issues/{key}/status`, `POST /api/issues/{key}/comments`) were found missing a
`catch (const Domain::Forbidden&)` handler and fixed -- this was caught by code inspection while editing
the surrounding code, not by compiling, since the file still cannot be built in this sandbox.

## 2026-07-31 — Phase 3, partial (fixed workflow and hierarchy, reduced scope)

Verified in the same session/environment as Phases 1-2 below: GCC 13.3.0, CMake 3.28.3, SQLite 3.45.1,
libpq 16.14, and a live local PostgreSQL 16.14 server (freshly created for this batch's verification and
dropped afterward, as in Phase 2).

### Core configuration

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DTICKETHUB_BUILD_SERVER=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build --parallel 4
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

All warnings enabled (`-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Wconversion -Wshadow`); zero warnings, including after
the `IDatabase::changeIssueStatus` signature change forced updates through `TicketService` and both
adapters, and after the `Domain::Issue`/`CreateIssueRequest` field additions.

### Passing tests (7/7)

1. `ticket-hub-domain-tests`, `ticket-hub-migration-tests`, `ticket-hub-identity-tests`,
   `ticket-hub-authorization-tests`, `ticket-hub-crypto-tests` — unchanged from Phase 1/2, all still
   passing.
2. `ticket-hub-sqlite-integration-tests` — updated: the existing `changeIssueStatus` call to transition
   an issue to `done` now passes a `resolution` (the call would otherwise fail Phase 3's new
   requirement), and asserts the resolution is stored; the deliberately-stale-version call that exercises
   `ConcurrencyConflict` was updated for the new parameter position but is otherwise unchanged.
3. `ticket-hub-workflow-tests` (new) — SQLite, exercised through `TicketService`:
   - hierarchy: a sub-task without a parent is rejected; an epic cannot have a parent; a story's parent
     must be an epic, not another story; a story can link to an epic in the same project; a sub-task's
     parent must be a story/task/bug, not an epic; a parent issue must be in the same project;
   - workflow: transitioning to Done without a resolution is rejected (`Domain::WorkflowViolation`); an
     unknown resolution key is rejected; a valid resolution is stored on completion; reopening does not
     require a resolution and clears the stored one (D70); a parent cannot complete while a sub-task is
     unfinished (D68) and can once the sub-task is done; reopening a completed parent leaves its
     sub-task's status untouched (D69).

### Additional verification beyond the automated suite

- **Live PostgreSQL 16 server**: created a scratch `tickethub` database/role (the server itself needed
  restarting first -- it was not still running from the Phase 2 session), ran `ticket-hub-cli
  migrate`/`seed-demo`, then compiled and ran a standalone program (`pg_phase3_smoke.cpp`, not committed)
  linking directly against `PostgresDatabase`: created an Epic and a Story linked to it (verifying
  `parent_issue_id` round-trips through `createIssue`/`findIssueByKey`), confirmed the Done-without-
  resolution rejection, confirmed a valid resolution is stored and then cleared on reopen, created a
  Sub-task under the Story and confirmed the parent cannot complete while it's unfinished, confirmed
  completing the Sub-task then lets the parent complete, and confirmed reopening the parent afterward
  leaves the Sub-task's status untouched. All 12 assertions passed. The scratch database and role were
  dropped after verification.
- Both SQLite and PostgreSQL adapters, `ticket-hub-core`, `ticket-hub-cli`, and all seven test binaries
  compile and link cleanly, including in the SQLite-only and PostgreSQL-only build configurations
  (`-DTICKETHUB_WITH_POSTGRES=OFF` / `-DTICKETHUB_WITH_SQLITE=OFF`).

### Environment limitations (unchanged from Phase 1-2)

`src/web/Api.cpp`, `src/web/HttpServer.cpp`, and `src/main.cpp` (the `ticket-hub` server target) still
could not be compiled -- outbound access to `github.com`, needed for CMake `FetchContent` to fetch Crow,
remains blocked. The Phase 3 route changes (`parentIssueKey` on `POST /api/issues`, `resolution` on
`PATCH /api/issues/{key}/status`, `Domain::WorkflowViolation` mapped to HTTP 422, `resolution` added to
issue JSON responses) follow the same patterns as the already-unverified Phase 1/2 routes and carry the
same caveat.

## 2026-07-31 — Phase 2 (authorization and projects, reduced scope)

Verified in the same session/environment as Phase 1 below: GCC 13.3.0, CMake 3.28.3, SQLite 3.45.1,
libpq 16.14, and a live local PostgreSQL 16.14 server (freshly created for this phase's verification and
dropped afterward).

### Core configuration

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DTICKETHUB_BUILD_SERVER=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build --parallel 4
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

All warnings enabled (`-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Wconversion -Wshadow`); zero warnings, in both the
initial database-layer compile and every subsequent incremental compile as the application layer
(`TicketService`), the new test binary, and the read-access-gating changes were added.

### Passing tests (6/6)

1. `ticket-hub-domain-tests`, `ticket-hub-migration-tests`, `ticket-hub-sqlite-integration-tests`,
   `ticket-hub-identity-tests`, `ticket-hub-crypto-tests` — unchanged from Phase 1, all still passing.
2. `ticket-hub-authorization-tests` (new) — SQLite, exercised through `TicketService` (not the raw
   database adapter, unlike the other integration tests) so the authorization layer itself is under
   test:
   - a project non-member cannot create an issue, change status, or comment in another project
     (`Domain::Forbidden`); a project member can; a project admin (not global admin) can too;
   - not-found semantics are unaffected by authorization: changing the status of an unknown issue still
     returns `false` (not `Forbidden`), commenting on one still raises `std::invalid_argument`;
   - the anonymous-read-access toggle: off by default, an anonymous caller is rejected
     (`Domain::AuthenticationRequired`) while off and admitted once a global administrator turns it on,
     an authenticated caller can always read regardless of the toggle, and only a global administrator
     may flip it;
   - the full project lifecycle authorization matrix: creation is global-admin-only even for another
     project's admin; archiving requires at least project-admin; the recycle bin
     (`listDeletedProjects`/`restoreProject`/`permanentlyDeleteProject`) is global-administrator-only even
     for the project's own admin, matching D88 ("admin restore or permanent delete"); soft-delete
     (moving to the bin) is available to a project admin.
   - One real bug caught by this suite before it was trusted: the test's first assertion expected an
     archived project to still appear (with `archived: true`) in `listProjects()`. The actual (pre-existing,
     correct) behavior is that `listProjects()` is the *active* project list and excludes archived/deleted
     projects entirely, per D87 ("leaves active lists"). The test assertion was wrong, not the
     implementation; it was corrected to assert the project's absence, then its return once unarchived.

### Additional verification beyond the automated suite

- **Live PostgreSQL 16 server**: created a scratch `tickethub` database/role, ran `ticket-hub-cli
  migrate`/`seed-demo`/`create-user` against it, then compiled and ran a standalone program
  (`pg_phase2_smoke.cpp`, not committed) linking directly against `PostgresDatabase` to exercise every
  Phase 2 method that could not be covered by the SQLite-only `authorization_integration_tests`:
  `getSetting`/`setSetting` (including the `ON CONFLICT` upsert), `findProjectRoleByKey`, `createProject`
  (including the auto-inserted creator-as-admin membership row), `setProjectArchived`,
  `softDeleteProject` (including its idempotent-false second call), `listDeletedProjects` (the `LATERAL`
  join and the on-demand `INTERVAL '90 days'` purge), `restoreProject`, and `permanentlyDeleteProject`
  (including its idempotent-false second call). All 17 assertions passed. The scratch database and role
  were dropped after verification; nothing PostgreSQL-specific was left running.
- Both SQLite and PostgreSQL adapters, `ticket-hub-core`, `ticket-hub-cli`, and all six test binaries
  compile and link cleanly.

### Environment limitations (unchanged from Phase 1)

`src/web/Api.cpp`, `src/web/HttpServer.cpp`, and `src/main.cpp` (the `ticket-hub` server target) still
could not be compiled -- outbound access to `github.com`, needed for CMake `FetchContent` to fetch Crow,
remains blocked. The new Phase 2 routes (`POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/projects/...`,
`GET/PUT /api/settings/anonymous-read`) and the read-route changes to resolve an optional `Principal`
follow the same patterns as the already-unverified Phase 1 routes and carry the same caveat: build and
smoke-test against a real Crow checkout before trusting them.

## 2026-07-31 — Phase 1 (identity and sessions, reduced scope)

Verified in the session environment with GCC 13.3.0, CMake 3.28.3, SQLite 3.45.1, libpq 16.14, and a
live local PostgreSQL 16.14 server.

### Core configuration

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DTICKETHUB_BUILD_SERVER=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build --parallel 4
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

All warnings enabled (`-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Wconversion -Wshadow`); zero warnings.

### Passing tests (5/5)

1. `ticket-hub-domain-tests` — project/issue key and label validation (unchanged), plus new email
   normalization/validation and password/create-user validation coverage.
2. `ticket-hub-migration-tests` — unchanged (ordered discovery, seed exclusion, stable checksums).
3. `ticket-hub-sqlite-integration-tests` — unchanged issue/comment/status coverage, updated to the
   email/user-id identity model (`assigneeEmail`, real user ids instead of usernames for
   reporter/actor/author).
4. `ticket-hub-identity-tests` (new) — SQLite: seeded-user login (validates the seed's own Argon2id
   hash), session validate/logout, unknown-token/empty-token rejection, identical error for
   wrong-password vs. unknown-email (anti-enumeration check), minimal login-attempt lockout tripping
   and staying locked even against a subsequently-correct password, administrator account creation,
   duplicate-email rejection, invalid-request rejection.
5. `ticket-hub-crypto-tests` (new) — SHA-256 known-answer vectors (empty string, `"abc"`, and the
   55/56/64-byte padding-boundary cases), Argon2id encode/verify round-trip, random-token uniqueness.

### Additional verification beyond the automated suite

- **Live PostgreSQL 16 server** (installed locally in this session, not just SQLite): ran
  `ticket-hub-cli migrate`, `seed-demo`, and `create-user` against a real database, inspected the
  resulting `users`/`local_credentials` schema and rows with `psql`, and ran a standalone program
  exercising `AuthService::login` → `validateSession` → `logout` end-to-end against it. This is strictly
  more PostgreSQL coverage than any prior session recorded in this repository, which previously noted
  "PostgreSQL runtime integration tests require an external test server."
- Confirmed the SQLite migration-runner's foreign-key-safe table-rebuild pattern (`PRAGMA foreign_keys
  OFF` → rebuild → `PRAGMA foreign_keys ON` + `PRAGMA foreign_key_check`) against a minimal standalone
  reproduction before trusting it in `004_identity.sql`, after the first attempt (a plain `ALTER TABLE
  ... DROP COLUMN username`) failed with SQLite's documented "cannot drop UNIQUE column" restriction.
- Both SQLite and PostgreSQL adapters, and the `ticket-hub-cli` target, compile and link cleanly.
- `cmake/FindArgon2.cmake` (new, no upstream CMake package exists for libargon2) resolves correctly via
  `find_package(Argon2 REQUIRED)`.

### Environment limitations

- **The `ticket-hub` server target (Crow) was not compiled.** Outbound HTTPS to `github.com` — needed
  for CMake `FetchContent` to fetch Crow — was blocked by this session's network egress policy (`403`).
  This is the same limitation recorded in every prior session
  (`handoff/IMPLEMENTATION_STATE.md`, the entry below). `src/web/Api.cpp`, `src/web/HttpServer.cpp`, and
  `src/main.cpp` were updated to match the new `AuthService`/`Principal`-based signatures and to add
  `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/logout`, `/api/auth/me`, and session-cookie/CSRF protection on existing
  write routes, but **none of this has been compiled or run**. Build and smoke-test the server target
  against a real Crow checkout before trusting it.
- No login page exists in `web/` yet; the demo UI does not call `/api/auth/login`.
- The 15-minute login lockout window could not be tested past the "still locked immediately after
  tripping" case — advancing wall-clock time inside a test is out of scope for this pass.

## 2026-07-30 — 0.2.0 baseline (prior session)

Verified in the provided Linux environment with GCC 14.2.0, SQLite 3.46.1 and libpq 17.9.

### Core configuration

```bash
cmake -S . -B build-core \
  -DTICKETHUB_BUILD_SERVER=OFF \
  -DTICKETHUB_WITH_POSTGRES=ON \
  -DTICKETHUB_WITH_SQLITE=ON
cmake --build build-core --parallel 4
ctest --test-dir build-core --output-on-failure
```

### Passing tests

1. `ticket-hub-domain-tests`
   - project key normalization and 2–12-character validation,
   - issue-key normalization and validation,
   - label normalization,
   - issue-create validation.

2. `ticket-hub-migration-tests`
   - ordered discovery,
   - exclusion of demo seed files,
   - stable content checksums.

3. `ticket-hub-sqlite-integration-tests`
   - ordered migration application and idempotence,
   - idempotent demo seed,
   - two projects returned exactly once,
   - eight seeded issues,
   - transactional creation of `TH-7`,
   - labels and detail readback,
   - permanent old-key alias resolution,
   - optimistic status update and version increment,
   - rejection of a stale update,
   - comment creation/listing,
   - dashboard counts and ordering,
   - rejection of a historical migration modified after application.

### Additional static validation

- Both SQLite and PostgreSQL adapters compile and link into `ticket-hub-core`.
- `ticket-hub-cli` compiles, reports version 0.2.0 and applies the schema to a fresh SQLite database.
- SQLite-only and PostgreSQL-only configurations both compile; all tests available in each configuration pass.
- Frontend JavaScript is checked with Node syntax validation when Node is available.

### Environment limitations

- A PostgreSQL server was not available for a live adapter integration test.
- Full Crow server configuration was attempted but could not fetch Crow because the sandbox could not resolve GitHub and no installed Crow package was available. The HTTP-layer source changes therefore were not compiled in this environment.
